-	Neural tube defects such as spina bifida or anencephaly.

__This test can also evaluate:__

-	Your baby’s lung development

-	Rh disease

__Reference range:__

The amniocentesis indications were: advanced maternal age (≥35 years) in 75 (40 %), high risk in triple screening test 51 (27 %), advanced maternal age and high risk in triple screening test 11 (6 %), high risk in first trimester screening test 11 (6 %), multiple fetal anomalies detected by obstetric ultrasonography in 14 (7 %), anxiety in cases 5 (3 %) and other indications in 22 cases (12 %). Abnormal karyotypes were detected in 11 of 189 cases (6 %): two trisomy 13 (1 %), two trisomy 18 (1 %), one Turner syndrome (1 %), three trisomy 21 (2 %), and three structural chromosomal anomalies (2 %). There was no pregnancy losses and maternal complication.
