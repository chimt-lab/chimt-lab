__Sample type__

Serum

__Uses__

Used in diagnosis

1-Myocardial infarction.

2-Crushing muscular trauma.

3-Any cardiac or muscle disease, but not myesthenia gravis or multiple sclerosus.

4-Brain injury.

5-Hypothyroidism.

6-Hypokalemia 

__Precautions__

No special precaution required.

__Interferring factor__

1_Its presence in serum interferes with the immunoinhibition methods normally used in emergency room laboratories that produce false elevations of the creatine kinase MB isoenzyme, and which may cause a misunderstanding in the evaluation of patients who are suspected of having ischemic cardiopathy.

2_The electrophoresis showed in all the cases the presence of a macro-creatine kinase type 1 responsible for this interference

3-Strenuous exercise or intramuscular injections may cause transient elevation of creatine kinase (CK)

 __Pre analytical error__

1-Hard exercises before the test affect the result.

2- hear diseases affect the result.

__Corrective action__

1-asking the patient if he athelets or making hard exercise.

2_taking medical history.

__Post-analytical errors__

1-Writing a wrong result or wrong name in the report

2-report were sent to incorrect patient

3-If  the patient's gender wrong in the report, and therefore I wrote the reference range wrong.

__The corrective actions__

1- If the report is not delivered to the patient and this error is discovered the correct result or the correct name must be written, but if the report is delivered to the patient must communicate with him and tell him that an error has occurred and replace with the correct report.

2-Communicate with patient ,apologizing for the error, and providing him with the correct report.

3-If the report is not delivered to the patient and this error is discovered the correct result must be written, but if the report is delivered to the patient must communicate with the patient, and apologize to him  tell him that an error has occurred and replace with the correct report. And next time be carful to write the correct gender and the correct reference range.
