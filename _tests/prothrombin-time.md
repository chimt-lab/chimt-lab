__Sample type:__ A blood sample (citrated)

__Uses:__

Evaluation of liver function reflecting abnormalities in factors VII, II, X, and V (but not VIII).  

To monitor long-term oral anticoagulant therapy with coumarin and indanedione derivatives.

PT is prolonged >PTT, and more consistently

__Precautions:__

Some medications, supplements, food and alcohol may affect test results.

Examples of medications that may affect PT test results include:

-	Some antibiotics.

-	Barbiturates.

-	Oral contraceptives.

-	Hormone replacement therapy.

__Interfering factor:__

-	Diet: ingestion of excessive green, leafy vegetables increases the body’s absorption of vitamin K, which promote blood clotting.

-	Alcoholism or excessive alcohol ingestion prolong PT level 

-	Prolonged storage of plasma at 4c –activate factor VII and shorten PT 

-	Diarrhea and vomiting decrease PT because of dehydration  

__Pre-analytical errors:__

Partially clotted specimens due to poor mixture with the anticoagulant (3.2 sodium citrate, as offered by manufacturers, blue top vacuum tubes).

Corrective action: Good mixing of the sample with the anticoagulant 


__Post analytical errors:__
-	Check instrument settings 

-	Assure that all preventive maintenance has been done 

-	Carry out troubleshooting functions called for in the SOP 

-	Call for equipment support

__Corrective action:__

-	Assure that the prescribed preventive maintenance for the instrument is performed
