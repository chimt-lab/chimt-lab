__Sample type__

Serum

__Uses__

A follow-up marker in patients with NSE-secreting tumors of any type An auxiliary test in the diagnosis of SCLC

An auxiliary test in the diagnosis of carcinoids, islet cell tumors, and   neuroblastomas   
An auxiliary tool in the assessment of comatose patients

__Precautions__

Values obtained with different assay methods should not be used interchangeably in serial testing.

It is recommended that only one assay method be used consistently to monitor each patient's course of therapy.

This procedure does not provide serial monitoring; it is intended for one-time use only

__Interfering factors__

Hemolysis can lead to significant artifactual NSE elevations, because erythrocytes contain NSE.

Proton pump inhibitor treatment, hemolytic anemia, hepatic failure, and end-stage renal failure can also result in artifactual NSE elevations.

__Pre-analytical errors__

Hemolyzed samples

__The corrective action__

Check samples by visual inspection 

Check samples by automated hemolysis index

Samples rejected due to hemolysis 



__Post-analytical errors__

1- Write another patient's name in the report

__The corrective action__

Make sure you write the correct name in the report

2-Writing a wrong result in the report

__The corrective action__

If the report is not delivered to the patient and this error is discovered the correct result must be written, but if the report is delivered to the patient must communicate with him and tell him that an error has occurred and replace with the ciorrect report

__Reference range__

3.7–8.9 μg/L
