__Sample type:__ 

Blood sample (citrate)

__Uses:__

-	Screening for hemophilia A and B and other possible coagulopathies (except factors VII and XIII). PTT does not detect single clotting factors defects above 40% of normal. 

-	Detection of clotting inhibitors. This is best performed by mixing studies once an otherwise unexplained prolonged PTT is found. Mixing equal parts of patient and normal plasma (1:1) for 1-hggggyyy2 hours at 37Â°C normalizes the prolonged PTT if it is caused by a coagulation factor deficiency but not if it is caused by an inhibitor. This inhibitor is most commonly factor VIII inhibitor, or it can be LA if sensitive reagents are used).


__Precaution:__

None; however, a high-fat meal prior to the blood draw may interfere with the test and should be avoided.

__Interfering factor:__

-	See appendix J for drug that affect test outcome.

-	Hemolized plasma shortens APTT in normal patient but not in abnormal (heparinized) patient.

-	Very increase or decrease Hct 

-	Incorrect ratio of blood to citrate 

__Pre-analytical errors:__

-	the ratio of patient plasma and normal plasma

-	the source and buffering status of the normal plasma

-	the conditions of incubation

__Post-analytical errors:__ 

-	the principle used in the interpretation of the results

-	Check instrument settings

__Reference range:__
