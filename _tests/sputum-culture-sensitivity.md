A test to find germs (such as bacteria or a fungus) that can cause an infection. A sample of sputum is added to a substance that promotes the growth of germs

__-	Sample type:__

 Sputum culture is a test that helps diagnose infections of the lungs or airways. Sputum is a thick mucus made in your lungs

__-	Uses:__

Uses a sample of this mucus to try to encourage the growth of any bacteria or other germs that may be causing an infection. A sputum culture test can reveal whether there is an infection in the lungs and, if so, the type of bacteria or fungus involved

__-	Precautions:__

Label the container with the patient's first and last name, MCP, and the date and time of collection of the sample. For sanitary reasons, the container must be enclosed in a plastic biohazard bag. Refrigerate the sputum sample and deliver to the Laboratory as soon as possible.

__-	Interfering Factors:__

 Any deviation from the standard procedure of sample collection, culture, staining, biochemical, molecular, and antimicrobial susceptibility tests can significantly impact the diagnostic result, directly affecting the patient's clinical management. 

__-	Pre analytical errors:__

Failure to follow the instructions or modification to the test system instructions will result in the test no longer meeting the requirements for waived classification and being classified as high complexity.

__-	Corrective action:__

Collecting a good quality sputum sample is the first step for getting an, the pathogens identified from sputum culture do not always originate from lower respiratory tract infections because they may be part of contaminant sites or preexisting in the oral flora. Thus, standard microbiological procedures for organisms' isolation and identification are critical for the sputum quality assessment.

__-	Post analytical errors:__

1. Results lost.

2. Request attached to wrong request.
