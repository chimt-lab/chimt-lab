n: Janus Kinase-2 DNA Mutation Assay
a: JAK2
s: j
---


__Sample type__

Whole blood, bone marrow or cell pellet

__Uses__

-	To help diagnose bone marrow disorders characterised by the overproduction of one or more types of blood cells known as myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs)

-	The JAK2V617F (exon 14) mutation analysis can be used in conjunction with bone marrow histology and cytogenetic analysis to assist in the diagnosis of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). The JAK2V617F mutation is found in almost all patients with polycythemia vera (PV) and in nearly one- half of those with idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF) and with essential thrombocythemia (ET). The V617F mutation has also been detected, although infrequently, in other myeloid disorders, such as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and chronic neutrophilic leukemia.

__Precautions__

You don't need any special preparations for an Janus Kinase-2 ( JAK2) DNA Mutation Assay

__Interfering factors__

-	The results of a genetic test may be affected by DNA rearrangements, blood transfusion, bone marrow transplantation, or rare sequence variations.

-	Genetic causes of MPDs, other than the V617F mutation, will not be detected.

__Pre-analytical errors__

-	Specimen does not meet collection criteria

-	frozen whole blood, marrow, or cell pellet

-	leaking tube

-	clotted blood or marrow

-	 grossly hemolyzed specimen or otherwise visibly degraded

-	contamination by another specimen

-	specimens containing suspicious foreign material

__The corrective action__

The sample must be rejected and another sample obtained

__Post-analytical errors__

1-reports sent to the wrong patient

2- -write the wrong name in the report or the wrong results.

__The corrective action__

1-communication with patient, apologising for the error, and providing him with the correct report

2-If the report is not delivered to the patient and this error is discovered, the correct result or the correct name must be written, but if the report is delivered to the patient, you must communicate with him, apologise to him, and tell him that an error has occurred and replace it with the correct report.

__Reference range__

an individual is negative for the JAK-2 gene mutation when the frequency of wild-type and mutant alleles is 100% and 0%, respectively
