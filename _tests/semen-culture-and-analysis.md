__Sample__ 

-	Semen 

__Uses__

-	Semen culture test is the laboratory test, which is done to check the presence of the microorganisms (aerobic and anaerobic) in the semen that causes an infectious condition (pathogen) in the semen of a man

-	When the semen sample contains white blood cells in it, doctors suggest the patient, undergoes this test. This also helps in identifying the particular microorganism and thereby finding the correct antibiotic for treatment.

__Precautions:__

-	The patient should not be on any antibiotic treatment when Semen Culture is performed or at least 7-10 days before. 

-	Before obtaining semen sample, the patient has to wash thoroughly the region with clean water only -and avoid any antiseptic that might potentially contaminate the specimen.  

-	The collecting container has to be sterile.

__Interfering factors:__

-	Any antiseptic that might potentially contaminate the specimen.  In every case, there is risk for false negative results (i.e. culture may demonstrate the presence of pathogenic microorganisms in the semen sample while there are not actually any). 






__Reference range:__

1)	Negative: no pathogenic microorganism is found.

2)	Positive: some pathogenic microorganism is found. In this case, an antibiogram follows with a list of antibiotic agents to which the microorganism is sensitive.

__Pre analytical error:__ 

1)	Specimens other than serum; improper labeling; samples not stored properly; samples older than stability limits; gross hemolysis; gross lipemia.

2)	 Take sample type different from that recommended in this test and analysis it in laboratory.

3)	Not to put the name of the patient or error when putting the code of patient on the tube when sampling.

4)	 sample is contaminated from technicians, this sample will be cultured in microbiology LAB.

__Corrective action:__ 

1)	refused the sample and ordered another sample.

2)	The sample should be rejected and order another sample. 

3)	anther sample request and should attention at next time.

4)	The sample must be rejected, and another sample will be requested.


__Post analytical error:__

1)	Sharing the results of patients or writing the result incorrectly.

2)	write a wrong Patient name   in patient report.

__Corrective action:__

1)	communicate with patient then delivered him the correct results   and   we apologize for this mistake.

2)	the report is not delivered to the patient and the error must be discovered.
