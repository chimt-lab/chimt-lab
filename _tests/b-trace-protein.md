__Sample type:__ 

Serum (red tube)

__Uses:__

is a low-molecular-weight glycoprotein and an emerging novel marker of glomerular filtration rate.

The B-Trace Protein test can also be used to reliably diagnose CSF rhinorrhea even slightly better than the beta2-transferrin test. It should not be used for patients with renal insufficiency and bacterial meningitis as they substantially increase serum and decrease CSF B-Trace Protein values, respectively.

the beta-2-transferrin assay is a highly sensitive and specific test for the presence of CSF in body fluids.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea is a condition where the fluid that surrounds the brain leaks into the nose and sinuses. Head trauma, surgery, or even birth defects can make a hole in the membranes that hold this fluid. It then leaks into your nose or ear, causing a watery, runny nose. 

__Precaution:__ 

The blood in the tubes was centrifuged using a Hettich Rotina 38R centrifuge device at 4000 rpm for 7 min and stored at −80 C. Serum and plasma were thawed at the same time at room temperature. 

__Interfering factors:__

Beta-trace protein has the prognostic ability to predict the GFR and the probability of end-stage 2 renal failure or GFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m as many as 2.591 times in hypertensive patients. Beta-trace protein is one of the renal function tests, which can be measured, and other kidney function tests in hypertensive patients to prevent complications leading to end-stage renal failure. 

__Pre analytical error:__ 

1)	Not taking a patient history 

2)	Don’t give the patient instruction about the test if he need to be fasting or abstaining from some medications 

__Corrective action:__

1)	 The technician must know the patient's history because this test needs to know if the patient suffers from kidney failure.

2)	Patient must be know if test need to be fasting or no. 

__Post analytical error:__ 

There is a problem in delivering the results or writing them in the patient report

__Corrective action:__

Attention when communicating the results to the patient

__Reference range:__
