__Sample type: -__

-	serum

__Uses: -__

-	Evaluation of possible primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency.

__Precautions: -__

-	The patient may have a fat-free meal prior to testing.

-	Although it may make more physiologic sense to perform the test during the nadir of endogenous ACTH production (around midnight) it is usually performed at 8:00-9:00 AM for ease of collection and comparison to normative data that was collected during that timeframe.

-	Blood is drawn for baseline studies and the ACTH (1-24) administered intramuscularly or intravenously.

-	If intramuscularly, 250 μg for patient weight of ≥37 pounds.

-	If intravenously, dilute the cosyntropin in 2 mL to 5 mL of normal saline and inject over two minutes.

-	Samples for analysis are collected 60 minutes after administration of the cosyntropin.

__Interfere factor: -__

-	Pregnancy, contraceptives, and estrogen therapy can give rise to elevated cortisol concentrations. 

-	In samples from patients who have been treated with prednisolone, methylprednisolone, or prednisone, falsely elevated concentrations of cortisol may be determined due to cross-reactivity. 

-	Patients suffering from 21-hydroxylase-deficiency exhibit elevated 21-deoxycortisol levels, and this can also give rise to elevated cortisol levels. Severe stress can also give rise to elevated cortisol concentrations.

__Pre analytical error: -__

-	Specimen not serum

__Corrective action: -__

-	The sample must be rejected, and another sample be obtained.

__Post analytical error: -__

-	Reports were sent to the incorrect patient

__Corrective action: -__

-	Communication with patient, apologizing for the error, and providing him with the correct report
