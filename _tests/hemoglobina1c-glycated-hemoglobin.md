__Sample type:__

Specimen Whole blood (Lavender-top (EDTA) tube).

__Use:__

1. Monitoring compliance and long-term blood glucose level control in patients with diabetes.

2. Index of diabetic control (direct relationship between poor control and development of
complications).

3. Predicting development and progression of diabetic microvascular complications.

Possibly for diagnosis of DM. Usefulness is still to be determined

__Interfering factors:__

1. Presence of Hb F and H causes falsely elevated values.

2. Presence of Hb S, C, E, D, G, and Lepore causes falsely decreased values

3. Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia can give a falsely high result; and hemolytic anemia, blood loss, chronic (ongoing) liver disease and chronic kidney disease can give a falsely low HbA1c result.

__Precautions:__

1. Technical will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial.

2. There is no need to fast before the test – you can eat and drink as normal. The results should be available within 24 hours.

3. The anticoagulant should be EDTA   


  __Pre analytical error:__ 

1)	 Specimens other than serum; improper labeling; samples not stored properly; samples older than stability limits; gross hemolysis; gross lipemia.

2)	Take sample type different from that recommended in this test and analysis it in laboratory.

3)	Not to put the name of the patient or error when putting the code of patient on the tube when sampling.

4)	Do not record the patient's history in the patient’s profile.

__Corrective action:__ 

1)	refused the sample and ordered another sample.

2)	The sample should be rejected and order another sample. 

3)	anther sample request and should attention at next time.

4)	Communicating with the patient and recording the patient history.

__Post analytical error:__

1)	Sharing the results of patients or writing the result incorrectly.

2)	write a wrong Patient name   in patient report.

__Corrective action:__

1)	communicate with patient then delivered him the correct results   and   we apologize for this mistake.

2)	the report is not delivered to the patient and the error must be discovered.


__Reference range:__ 

Normal: HbA1c below 5.7%

 Prediabetes: HbA1c between 5.7% and 6.4%

 Diabetes: HbA1c of 6.5% or higher
