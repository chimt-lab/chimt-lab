__Uses: -__

Predicts recurrence after radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer and following response to androgen ablation therapy, when used in conjunction with PSA.

__Precaution: -__

-	Remember that morning is recommended because diurnal variation exists. 

-	Place specimen in a biohazard bag, transport to lab immediately, and place on ice.

__Interfere action: -__

1.	Various drugs may cause increased and decreased PAP levels. 

2.	Palpation of the prostate gland and prostate biopsy before testing causes increases in PAP levels.

3.	Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and bladder catheterization cause increased levels.

__Pre analytical error: -__

-	When collecting specimens in an unsterile tube, the sample becomes contaminated, leading to an incorrect result.

__Corrective action: -__

-	The sample must be rejected, and another sample obtained because the sample should be collected in sterile tubes. 

__Post analytical error: -__

-	The reference range was written incorrectly.

__Corrective action: -__

-	 If the report is not delivered to the patient and this error is discovered, fix it, but if the report is delivered to the patient, apologize to him, tell him that an error has occurred, and replace it with the correct report.

And next time, be careful when you write down the reference range.

__Reference range: -__

2.5–3.7 ng/mL or 2.5–3.7 µg/L
