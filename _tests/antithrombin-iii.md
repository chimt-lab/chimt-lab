Antithrombin III (AT III) is a protein that helps control blood clotting. A blood test can determine the amount of AT III present in your body.

__-	Sample type:__

Heparin tubes.

__-	Uses:__

Antithrombin acts as a natural blood thinner. If your blood clots when it isn't supposed to, your doctor may order an antithrombin III blood test. This measures the amount of antithrombin protein in your body to learn if you have an antithrombin deficiency that's causing your blood to clot more easily than normal.

__-	Precautions:__

-	The site is cleaned with germ-killing medicine (antiseptic).

-	An elastic band is put around the upper arm to apply pressure to the area. This makes the vein below it swell with blood.

-	A needle is inserted into the vein.

-	The blood collects into an airtight vial or tube attached to the needle

__-	Interfering Factor:__

-	Antithrombin III inhibits clotting factors IIa (thrombin), Xa, and to a lesser extent IXa and XIIa. UFH and LMWH bind to antithrombin III via a pentasaccharide group, inducing a conformational change which enhances antithrombin-mediated inhibition of these clotting factors.

__-	Pre analytical errors:__

i.	Use errors specimen collected and those unrelated to order

ii.	Entry insufficient specimen quantity

__-	Corrective action:__

 A correction is an immediate action taken to fix an issue identified during an audit or while monitoring and corrective action works to resolve the root cause of the issue. Preventative action is one taken to prevent a food safety problem in the future

__-	Post analytical errors:__

1.	Evaluation of test results

2.	Decision to release test results

3.	Preparation of the laboratory test report

4.	Release of the laboratory test report
