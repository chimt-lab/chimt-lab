The urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP) test is used to estimate how much of certain proteins are in the urine.

__Sample Type:__

Urine

__Uses:__

-	to help determine the cause of protein in the urine. 

-	Or it may be done as a screening test to measure the various amounts of different types of proteins in urine. 

-	UPEP detects 2 types of protein: albumin and globulins.

__Precautions:__

stop taking certain medicines that could interfere with the test. Medicines that can affect test results include:

- Chlorpromazine

- Corticosteroids

- Isoniazid

- Neomycin

- Phenacemide

- Salicylates

- Sulfonamides

- Tolbutamide

Do not stop taking any medicine without first talking to your provider.

__Interfering Factors:__

-	Increased levels of certain proteins can indicate:

- Kidney disorder and inability to filter proteins out of blood

- Infection

-	Decreased levels of urine proteins are rarely of any clinical concern

__Pre-Analytical errors:__

-	Error in the sample

-	The electrophoretic system

-	The electric field

-	Temperature of the system, pH of the ions

-	Concentration of buffer.

__Corrective Action:__

-	Correctly adjust all system component, including:

(Electricity, PH, temperature and buffer)

__Post analytical errors:__

-	Incorrect reference values

-	Physician not notified of a panic or critical value

-	Incorrect interpretation of lab results by physician 

-	Incorrect data entry of lab result

__Reference Range:__

A descriptive report is prepared by the pathologist.
