__Sample type:__  

plasma samples 

__Uses:__

Traditionally, the solubility of fibrin clot in concentrated urea, acetic acid or monochloroacetic acid solution was used to screen for FXIII deficiency.

__Interfering factor:__

The clot solubility test is not standardized, and careful consideration is mandatory. The sensitivity of this method is dependent upon fibrinogen level, the reagent used for clotting (Ca2+, thrombin, etc.), and the solubilizing agents (MCA acid, acid acetic, or 5 M urea). Combination of acetic acid/thrombin, acetic acid/calcium, urea/calcium, and urea/thrombin can modify the relative sensitivity of clot solubility assays
 

__Pre-analytical error:__

-	Inappropriate or wrongly handled procedures. 

-	Problems may arise during the collection of blood specimens 

-	Some factors can alter the result of a sample constituent after collection during transportation, preparation and storage.

__Corrective action__ 

Proper sample collection and handling.

__Post analytical errors:__

-	Check instrument settings 

-	Assure that all preventive maintenance has been done 

-	Carry out troubleshooting functions called for in the SOP 

-	Call for equipment support

__Corrective action:__

-	Assure that the prescribed preventive maintenance for the instrument is performed
