__Sample type: -__

Serum or plasma (EDTA)

__Uses: -__

-	Higher adiponectin levels are associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes across diverse populations, consistent with a dose–response relationship.

-	Levels of adiponectin are significantly reduced in obese subjects compared to nonobese subjects. Levels of adiponectin are reduced in diabetics compared to nondiabetics. Weight reduction significantly increases circulating levels.

__Precaution: -__

No special precaution required. 

__Interfere action: -__

-	Adiponectin exerts some of its weight reduction effects via the brain. This is like the action of leptin, but the two hormones perform complementary actions and can have additive effects.

-	Due to its important cardiometabolic actions, adiponectin represents a biologic molecule worth being studied as a new emerging biomarker of disease and as a target for pharmacologic treatments.

__Pre analytical error: -__

-	The patient eating much sugar before test. 

-	Use another test tube.

__Corrective action: -__

-	The lab specialist should be telling the patient the procedure before testing.

-	We must use the red-top tube, gel-barrier tube, or lavender-top (EDTA) tube.

__Post analytical error: -__

-	Unlabeled the test.

-	Send the result to wrong patient.

-	Wrong calculations.

__Corrective action: -__

-	Ask for another sample and apologize for the mistake.

-	Repeat the calculation and ask to resend the result and apologize.
