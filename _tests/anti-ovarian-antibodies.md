Anti-Ovarian Antibody test is done on a blood sample to estimate the level of Anti Ovarian Antibodies in the bloodstream. It's conducted to confirm female infertility as well as used during and after the infertility treatment. Antibodies are produced against the ovaries (autoimmunity) and this kind of antibodies bind to the vital functional sites of the ovaries and granulosa cells to obstruct the normal response. As per researches, anti-ovarian antibodies cause disturbances in normal ovulation process. They are also likely to be involved as a cause of non-responsive function to different medications (as well as techniques like IVF) for stimulating proper ovarian action. Patients with Premature Ovarian Failure and unexplained infertility have higher levels of such antibodies. Hence, these antibodies are believed to play role in female infertility.

__Sample Type:__

Serum

__Uses:__

This advanced test assists to assess abnormalities that can impair the normal functions of the female reproductive system:

- Women who are experiencing Premature Ovarian Failure (POF) or have higher 3 FSH level or poor response to gonadotropin stimulation are given this AOA test to determine the presence of these antibodies.

- Usually, 30% healthy women have these antibodies although in smaller quantities. So, they do not interfere with normal ovarian function.

-  Women with poor response to hormone therapy, irregularities in implantation, low success rates in IVF have a large amount of Anti-ovarian Abs. 

- Even in females, suffering from Addison's Disease or Thyroid diseases, anti-ovarian antibodies have been found. If the test result comes negative, then the infertility is probably due to some other reason and not Anti-ovarian antibodies. In case of positive results, these antibodies may be playing a vital role in infertility.
