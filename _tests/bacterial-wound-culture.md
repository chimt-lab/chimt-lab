2.	When burn tissue specimens have a specific bacterial count above a certain number, then removal of dead tissue may be indicated.

__Interfering factors__

Wound culture results may be less predictive of what is causing the infection when a person has already been treated with antibiotics or when a person has a chronic infection.
