__Sample type__

Serum

__Uses__

1-Lp-PLA2 is considered a risk marker rather than a risk factor for cardiac heart disease.

2-In conjunction with hsCRP assay can reliably stratify low-, intermediate-, and high-risk populations.

- Increased Lp-PLA2 with low LDL-C increases risk of heart disease two times.

- Increased Lp-PLA2 with high CRP increases risk of heart disease three times.

__Precautions__

No special precaution required

__Interferring factor__

1-Smoking increases Lp-PLA2 measurements.

__Pre analytical error__

Smoking affect the result 

__Corrective action__

Insure that patient does not smoke before the test .

__Post-analytical errors__

1-Writing a wrong result or wrong name in the report

2-report were sent to incorrect patient

__The corrective actions__

1- If the report is not delivered to the patient and this error is discovered the correct result or the correct name must be written, but if the report is delivered to the patient must communicate with him and tell him that an error has occurred and replace with the correct report.

2-Communicate with patient ,apologizing for the error, and providing him with the correct report.

__Reference range__ 

Negative: <14 RU/mL

Borderline: > or =14-<20 RU/mL

Positive: > or =20 RU/mL
