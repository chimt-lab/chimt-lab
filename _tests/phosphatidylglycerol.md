__Sample type__

Amniotic Fluid

__Uses__

-	Assessing fetal lung maturity

-	Determining the ability of fetal lungs to produce sufficient quantities of pulmonary surfactant.

-	Predicting the likelihood of the development of respiratory distress

 syndrome if the fetus were delivered. 

__Precautions__ 

Do not centrifuge

Amniotic specimens must be free of blood and meconium contamination.

__Interfering factors__

AmnioStat-FLM is not subject to artifacts associated with other lung surfactant tests. 

TLC test can produce false-positive test results with meconium contamination and vaginal fluid contamination. 

The absence of PG or low levels of PG cannot dependably predict the presence of RDS. 

Diabetes, regardless of glucose control, delays PG production.

__Pre-analytical errors__

1.	If the sample was not collected with the correct instructions.

__The corrective action__

The sample should be rejected and another sample requested.

2.	Gross hemolysis, mislabeled or unlabeled specimens 

__The corrective action__

 The sample must be rejected and another sample be obtained


__Post-analytical errors__

I.	reports were sent to the incorrect patient

__The corrective action__

communication with patient, apologizing for the error, and providing him with the correct report

II.	write the wrong name in the report or the wrong results.

__The corrective action__

If the report is not delivered to the patient and this error is discovered, the correct result or the correct name must be written, but if the report is delivered to the patient, you must communicate with him, apologies to him, and tell him that an error has occurred and replace it with the correct report.

__Reference range__

Immature: <15,000/mcL

Indeterminate: 15,000-50,000/mcL

Mature: >50,000/mcL
