__Sample type__

Blood sample ( EDTA Blood) . 

__Uses__

1. RBC count can help diagnose anemia . 

2. Other conditions that affect red blood cells:-  Disorder in which red blood cells break down earlier than normal (paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria)



__Precautions__ 

1. Some medications can affect red blood cell count. 

__Interfering factors__ 

1. Endogenous interferences consist of some important factors such as hemolysis. 

2. Exogenous interferences include drugs and chemical additives that are used in some devices 


__preanalytic errors__ 

1. Inappropriate blood collection is a major source of preanalytic errors. For instance,inappropriate filling of test tube results in excess anticoagulant, thereby diluting the blood and decreasing the red cell parameters. 

 2. very low temperature may lyse red blood cell

__Corrective action__ 

1.	Appropriate amount of anticoagulant and dilution should be taken in consideration. 

2.	Anticoagulated blood may be stored at 4Â°C for 24
hours. 

__Post analytical errors__ 

the most common mistakes are wrong validation; delayed results, not reported or reported to the wrong providers. 

__Corrective action__

Make sure that the result are reported to the correct provider and at the correct time. 

__Normal RBC ranges__

- Male: 4.7 to 6.1 million cells per microliter (cells/mcL) 

- Female: 4.2 to 5.4 million cells/mcL
