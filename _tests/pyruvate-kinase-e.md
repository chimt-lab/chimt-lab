__Sample type:__

-	Whole blood(EDTA) lavender top tube

-	(ACD-Solution B) yellow top tube

__Uses:__

-	Evaluation of nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia.-

-	Investigating families with PK deficiency to determine inheritance pattern and for genetic
Counseling.

__Precautions:__

-	no special patient preparation-

-	Do Not centrifuge.-

-	Send whole blood refrigerated in original collection container. 

-	Do not transfer blood to other containers. -

-	Store and ship at refrigerated temperatures.

__Interfering factors:__

-	Patients who have recently received transfusions have normal donor cells that may mask PK-deficient erythrocytes.

-	Because leukocytes also contain pyruvate kinase that is not diminished in hereditary erythrocytic pyruvate kinase deficiency, freeing the blood of white blood cells is always critical to this test.

-	frozen sample

-	Hemolyzed sample

__Pre analytical errors:__

frozen sample, mislabeled or unlabeled specimens,hemolyzed sample

__Corrective actions:__

The sample should be rejected and another sample requested

__Post analytical errors:__

1.	Writing a wrong result or wrong name in the report

2.	Report were sent to incorrect patient

__Corrective actions:__

1.	If the report is not delivered to the patient and this error is discovered, the correct result or the correct name must be written, but if the report is delivered to the patient, you must communicate with him, apologize to him, and tell him that an error has occurred and replace it with the correct report.

2.	Communicate with patient ,apologizing for the error, and providing him with the correct report

__Reference range:__
