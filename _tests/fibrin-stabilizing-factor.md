__Sample type:__

Plasma 

__Uses:__

Factor XIII testing is indicated when factor XIII deficiency is suspected.

__Precaution :__

__Patient Preparation:__

Avoid warfarin therapy for two weeks prior to the test and heparin, direct Xa, and thrombin inhibitor therapies for about three days prior to testing.

__sample collection:__ 

The test is done with a blood sample. A needle is used to draw blood from a vein in your arm or hand.

__Interfering factors:__

1.	Partial clotting of specimens resulting from poor mixing of anticoagulant (3:2 sodium citrate as per manufacturerâ€™s blue topped tube)

2.	Overfilling or underfilling of test tubes, altering the blood-to-anticoagulant ratio (9:1)

3.	Improper storage of plasma

4.	Contamination with heparin or, if indwelling catheters are in place, dilution of the collected sample

__Pre - analytical errors:__

1. Severe hemolysis; improper labeling; clotted specimen; specimen diluted with IV fluids; samples thawed in transit; improper sample type; sample out of stability

2. Overfilled or underfilled test tubes altering the ratio of blood to anticoagulant.

__Corrective action :__

Proper sample collection and handling.

__Post analytical errors:__

1.	Writing wrong name in the report

2.	Writing a wrong result in the report

__The corrective action__

1. Make sure you write the correct name in the report or use codes that  contain all patient data . 

2. If the report is not delivered to the patient and this error is discovered the correct result must be written, but if the report is delivered to the patient must communicate with him and tell him that an error has occurred and replace with the correct report

__The reference range for factor XIII:__ 

Factor XIII, an enzyme that cross-links fibrin, belongs to the blood coagulation system. Screening for factor XIII, also known as fibrin-stabilizing factor, is performed when its absence is suspected. Qualitatively, factor XIII levels are referred to as decreased or normal.  Quantitation of the enzyme's levels is carried out in research laboratories.
