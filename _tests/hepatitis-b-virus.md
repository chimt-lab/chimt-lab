__Sample type:__

Serum (red tube)

__Uses:__

1.	Hepatitis B is a viral infection that causes inflammation of the liver. Hepatitis B test results can identify present hepatitis B infection, past exposure to HBV, or immunity to the virus.

2.	Hepatitis B surface antigens are proteins present on the surface of the hepatitis B virus. These proteins can be detected in high levels during both an acute or chronic hepatitis B infection. This test may be used to screen for, detect, and help diagnose acute and chronic HBV infections.

__Precaution:__

1.	This test should not be used to test or screen for chronic hepatitis B in pregnant women. For testing such patients, order HBAGP / Hepatitis B Surface Antigen Prenatal, Serum.

2.	This test should not be used to screen or test asymptomatic, nonpregnant individuals with or without risk factors for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. For testing such patients, order HBGSN / Hepatitis B Surface Antigen Screen, Serum.

3.	This test is not intended for testing cadaver or grossly hemolyzed specimens. For testing such patients, order   Hepatitis B Surface Antigen for Cadaveric or Hemolyzed Specimens, Serum, which is FDA-approved for testing on these sources.


__Interfering factors:__

1.	 false positive results of HBsAg due to the recent Hepatitis B vaccine among healthy male adults.

2.	Problems with the test during do this test (ELIAS):

    1.	Improper washing procedure. 

    2.	Contamination with positive specimen.

    3.	Wrong volume of sample, conjugate or substrates. 

    4.	Contamination of the well rim with conjugate

    5.	Improper specimen, such as hemolyzed serum or plasma, specimen containing sediments and specimen not thoroughly mixed before use.

    6.	Wrong incubation time or temperature.  

    7.	Obstructed or partial obstructed washer aspirate/dispense head and needles. 



__Pre analytical error:__ 

1.	Specimens other than serum; improper labeling; samples not stored properly; samples older than stability limits; gross hemolysis; gross lipemia.

2.	Take sample different from that will analysis it in laboratory. 

3.	Not to put the name of the patient or error when putting the code of patient on the tube when sampling.

4.	Do not record the patient's history in the patientâ€™s profile.

__Corrective action:__ 

1.	refused the sample and ordered another sample.

2.	The sample should be rejected and order another sample. 

3.	anther sample request and should attention at next time.

4.	Communicating with the patient and recording the patient history.



__Post analytical error:__

1.	Sharing the results of patients or writing the result incorrectly.

2.	write a wrong Patient name   in patient report.

__Corrective action:__

1.	communicate with patient then delivered him the correct results   and   we apologize for this mistake.

2.	the report is not delivered to the patient and the error must be discovered.
