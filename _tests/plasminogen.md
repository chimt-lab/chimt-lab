__Interfering factors__

Hemolysis

Grossly lipemic

Grossly lcteric

Clotting 

__Pre-analytical errors__

1- Improper tube,clotted,hemolyzed samples,underfilled tubes, overfilled tubes,mislabbeled or unlabeled samples.

2- If the samples is grossly lipemic after centrifugate it

3- you received a sample was collected on a non-sodium citrate anticoagulant


__The corrective actions__

1- The sample must be rejected and another sample will be requested.

2- Centrifuge the sample again, if it still lipemic reject this sample and another sample will be requested
