__Sample type:__

Serum (preferred) or plasma heparin.

__Uses:__

The test helps in knowing how the kidneys function.

The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) provides an assessment of the filtering capacity of the kidney. 


__Pecuations :__

Maintain specimen at room temperature.

__Interfering factors:__

Muscle mass affects the test accuracy.

__Preanalytical errors:__

Collect the sample on the wrong tube.

__Corrective action:__

Collecting the sample on the right tube.

__Postanalytical errors:__

Losing the data of the patient.

__Corrective action:__

Never lose the data of the patient and having soft and hard copies of the report.

__Referance range :__

eGFR of 90 or higher is in the normal range

eGFR of 60 -89 may mean early kidney disease

eGFR of 15 -59 may mean kidney disease

eGFR below 15 may mean kidney failure
