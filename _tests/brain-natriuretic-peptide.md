__Sample type:__

Plasma (EDTA tube)

__Uses:__ 

Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) test is a blood test that measures levels of a protein called BNP that is made by your heart and blood vessels. BNP levels are higher than normal when you have heart failure. diagnosis of congestive heart failure (CHF) 

__Precaution:__  

-	Should be sampling on EDITA tube

-	Knowing the patient's age 

__Interfering factors:__ 

-	the false elevated BNP values may be a result of an abnormal immunoassay response with either interference from heterophilic antibodies, human anti‐mouse antibodies or rheumatoid factors, which can commonly lead to false results on sandwich‐type assays, as well as BNP results.
 
-	BNP increases with arrhythmias that are less marked.

-	BNP and NT-proBNP can be increased in renal failure, especially if dialysis is needed 

-	Age and exercise also increase BNP.

-	Obesity decreases BNP.

-	Intraindividual variation (approximately 50% and 60%, respectively, for BNP and NTproBNP from week to week) indicates altered cardiac status. 

__Pre analytical error:__ 

Eating food containing salt (sodium) can result in fluid retention in the healthiest of people this may be increase BNP

__Corrective action:__ 

Patient don’t eating anything containing salt 

__Post analytical error:__

Changing the results due to the exchange of patients' names from receptionist.  

__Corrective action:__

 Attention when delivering the results and reviewing them with the patient's report. 

__Reference range:__ 

-	BNP: <100 pg/mL 

-	NT-proBNP: 0–74 years of age: ≤124 pg/mL

-	75 years of age and older: ≤449 pg/mL
