__Sample type__

Serum(preferred)

Plasma (lithium heparin)

__Uses__

-Diagnosis and treatment of diseases involving the liver, kidney, or bone marrow, as well as other metabolic or nutritional disorder

-Screening for nutritional deficiencies and gammopathies

__Precautions__

-Separate serum or plasma from cells within four hours of collection.

-Do not use oxalate, EDTA, or citrate plasma.

Maintain specimen at room temperature.-

__Interfering factors__

Hemolysis-

-Serum from patient receiving dextran may cause high levels due to turbidity during color development.

-Falsely elevated proteins (pseudohyperproteinemia) can be caused by  hemoconcentration due to dehydration or sample desiccation 

-Upright posture for several hours after rising increases total proteins and several other
analytes.

__Pre-analytical errors__

1- Use oxalate, EDTA, or citrate plasma

2-Hemolyzed or unlabeled samples

3- Patient receiving dextran

4-If the sample was drawn and the patient was standing for a long time before it.

__The corrective actions__

1-Sample should be rejected and other sample requested

2-Sample should be rejected and other sample requested

3-Centrifuging the reaction mixture before reading the absorbance can be minimize the effect of this drug on the result

4-The patient must rest and sit for a period of time before taking the sample.

__Post-analytical errors__

1-Writing a wrong result or wrong name in the report

2-report were sent to incorrect patient

__The corrective actions__

1- If the report is not delivered to the patient and this error is discovered, the correct result or the correct name must be written, but if the report is delivered to the patient, you must communicate with the patient, apologise to him, and tell him that an error has occurred and replace it with the correct report.

2-Communicate with patient ,apologizing for the error, and providing him with the correct report.

7 days–1 year: 4.4–7.5 g/dL
