s: i
---


__Sample type__

Serum (Red-top tube or gel-barrier tube)

__Uses__

-	Diagnosing growth disorders 

-	Diagnosing adult growth hormone deficiency 

-	Monitoring of recombinant human growth hormone treatment

-	Possible adjunct to IGF-I(Insulin-like Growth Factor- l) and growth hormone in the diagnosis and followup of acromegaly and gigantism

__Precautions__

This test may exhibit interference when sample is collected from a person who is consuming a supplement with a high dose of biotin (also termed as vitamin B7 or B8, vitamin H, or coenzyme R). It is recommended to ask all patients who may be indicated for this test about biotin supplementation. Patients should be cautioned to stop biotin consumption at least 72 hours prior to the collection of a sample.

__Interfering factors__

Several factors influence IGFBP-3 levels, including age, sexual development, nutrition, and hepatic and renal function. IGFBP-3 increases during early childhood and puberty and then decreases slightly in adult life. Levels of this binding protein decrease during fasting and chronic malnutrition. IGFBP-3 levels are decreased in hepatic failure and diabetes mellitus, but are increased in chronic renal failure.

__Pre-analytical errors__

Gross hemolysis or Gross icterus

__The corrective action__

The sample must be rejected and another sample be obtained.

__Post-analytical errors__ 

1- reports were sent to the incorrect patient

2- write the wrong name in the report or the wrong results.

__The corrective action__

1-communication with patient, apologising for the error, and providing him with the correct report

2- If the report is not delivered to the patient and this error is discovered, the correct result or the correct name must be written, but if the report is delivered to the patient, you must communicate with him, apologise to him, and tell him that an error has occurred and replace it with the correct report.
