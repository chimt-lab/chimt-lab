2. Drugs that may cause decreased iron include some antibiotics, aspirin, and testosterone.

3. Hemolysis of the blood sample interferes with testing.

4. Iron contamination of glassware used in testing can give high values.

5. Menstruation causes decreased iron; iron is elevated in the premenstrual period.

6. There is a diurnal variation in iron: normal values in the morning, lower in midafternoon, very low in the evening.

__Pre - analytical errors:__

1-	Collecting the sample in the evening when iron level is very low

2-	 If the patient has Menstruation it will cause decrease in iron level

3-	 premenstrual period iron level is elevated
