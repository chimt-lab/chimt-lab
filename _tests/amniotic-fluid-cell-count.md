__Sample type:__

-	Amniotic, amniocentesis fluid.

-	Sterile container or lavender-top (EDTA) tube or green-top (heparin) tube

__Uses:__

-	Evaluate amniotic fluid for the presence of RBCs (semiquantitative), WBCs, differential, and for physical appearance

__Precautions:__

Prior to amniocentesis, an ultrasound examination should be performed.

__Ultrasound examination is used to:__

-	Confirm fetal gestational age

-	Detect gross fetal anomalies

-	Verify fetal cardiac activity

-	Determine placental location

-	Determine volume of amniotic fluid

-	Determine the number of gestational sacs

-	Determine the correct abdominal puncture site

__Interfering Factors:__

-	Leukocyte (WBC) count is often of limited value; however, amniotic fluid infection or chorioamnionitis is usually associated with polymorphonuclear leukocytosis (>100/Î¼L). 

-	Controversy exists in the literature concerning the significance of the presence of leukocytes in amniotic fluid.

-	 Some studies reflect the absence of leukocytes and bacteria was associated with a negative amniotic fluid culture in 77.9% to 95% of the patients.

__Pre analytical errors:__

1.	Inappropriate specimen received.

2.	Unlabeled specimen or name discrepancy between specimen and request label;

3.	Specimen received after prolonged delay (usually more than 72 hours); 

4.	Specimen received in expired transport container.

__Corrective action:__

1.	Appropriate specimen received.

2.	Labeled specimen and no name discrepancy between specimen and request label.

3.	Specimen received without delay.

4.	Specimen received in valid transport container.

__Post analytical errors:__

1.	Failure in reporting. 

2.	Erroneous validation of analytical data.

3.	Improper data entry.

__Corrective action:__

1.	Write correct report.

2.	All analytical data should be valid.

3.	Proper data entry.
