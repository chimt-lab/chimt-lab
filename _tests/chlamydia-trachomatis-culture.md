__Sample type:__

•	Chlamydia is an intracellular pathogen. 

•	Obtain swab specimens containing epithelial cells of conjunctiva, cervix, posterior nasopharynx, throat, rectum, or urethra.

__Uses:__

•	Aid in the diagnosis of infections, including medical/legal cases caused by Chlamydia trachomatis (eg, cervicitis, trachoma, conjunctivitis, PID, pneumonia, urethritis, nongonococcal urethritis, pneumonitis, and sexually-transmitted diseases).

__Precautions:__

•	Clean the area of inflammatory cells and then attempt to use another swab to scrape epithelial cells for culturing.

•	Direct immunofluorescence techniques and nucleic acid amplification assays are available to detect Chlamydia in clinical specimens.

•	Urine culture for Chlamydia is not a sensitive procedure and generally should not be done.

__Interfering Factors:__

•	Culture may be negative in the presence of Chlamydia infection.

•	The sensitivity of culture is only 70% to 90% because C trachomatis may not survive transit to the laboratory and may lead to false negative.

__Pre analytical errors:__ 

1.	Inadequate sampling.

2.	Low numbers of organisms in asymptomatic infection.

__Corrective action:__

1.	Adequate sampling.

2.	Large numbers of organisms in asymptomatic infection.

__Post analytical errors:__

1.	Failure in reporting. 

2.	Erroneous validation of analytical data.

3.	Improper data entry.

__Corrective action:__

1.	Write correct report.

2.	All analytical data should be valid.

3.	Proper data entrty.
