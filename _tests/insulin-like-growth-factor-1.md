a: IGF-I
s: i

__Sample type__

Serum (Red-top tube or gel-barrier tube)

__Uses__

-	Diagnosis of acromegaly and pituitary deficiency; preferable to GH because it is constant after eating and during the day

-	Help determine optimum dosage of GH

-	Screening other growth disorders

-	Assessing nutritional status 

-	Monitoring effectiveness of nutritional repletion; a more sensitive indicator than prealbumin, transferrin index, or retinol-binding protein

__Precautions__

This test may exhibit interference when sample is collected from a person who is consuming a supplement with a high dose of biotin (also termed as vitamin B7 or B8, vitamin H, or coenzyme R). It is recommended to ask all patients who may be indicated for this test about biotin supplementation. Patients should be cautioned to stop biotin consumption at least 72 hours prior to the collection of a sample.

__Interfering factors__

-	Malnutrition or not eating (fasting) will affect your results. 

-	Age also affects your results, as both IGF-1 and GH decline after puberty.

__Pre-analytical errors__

1-Plasma specimen or Gross hemolysis

__The corrective action__

1-The sample must be rejected and another sample be obtained.

__Post-analytical errors__ 

1- reports were sent to the incorrect patient

2- write the wrong name in the report or the wrong results.

__The corrective action__

1-communication with patient, apologising for the error, and providing him with the correct report

2- If the report is not delivered to the patient and this error is discovered, the correct result or the correct name must be written, but if the report is delivered to the patient, you must communicate with him, apologise to him, and tell him that an error has occurred and replace it with the correct report.
