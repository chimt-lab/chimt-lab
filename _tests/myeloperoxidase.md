1-It has been demonstrated that elevations of MPO can occur with the administration of
heparin products, potentially confounding its accuracy.

2-Elevated in rheumatoid arthritis.

__Pre analytical error__

Taking heparin and autoimmune disease (Rheumatoid arthritis) raise the MPO 

__Corrective action__

Taking medical history of the patient and their medications.

__Post-analytical errors__

1-Writing a wrong result or wrong name in the report

2-report were sent to incorrect patient

__The corrective actions__

1- If the report is not delivered to the patient and this error is discovered the correct result or the correct name must be written, but if the report is delivered to the patient must communicate with him and tell him that an error has occurred and replace with the correct report.

2-Communicate with patient ,apologizing for the error, and providing him with the correct report.
