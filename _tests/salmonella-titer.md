__Sample type:__

1. Blood sample (blood culture)

2. Urine sample

3. Stool sample

__Uses:__

Indicates acute infection, helps to identify the type of enteric fever.

__Precaution:__

-	Faces or a rectal swab, blood, urine, and sterile site swabs collected into a sterile container.

-	Faecal specimens should be collected in the early stages (preferably within 4 days of onset),

-	Faecal specimens should be transported to the laboratory as soon as possible, preferably in less than 4h.

__Interfering factors:__

In contrast to E. coli, Salmonella does not produce indole because it does not harbor tna A, which encodes the enzyme responsible for tryptophan metabolism.

__Pre analytical errors__

a)	Missing sample and/or test request

b)	Wrong or missing identification

c)	Contamination from infusion route

d)	Hemolysis, clotted, and insufficient samples

e)	Inappropriate containers

f)	Inappropriate blood to anticoagulant ratio

__Corrective action:__

-	Transported specimen to the laboratory as soon as possible or can be stored at room temperature for 24h4.

-	Ideally, faucal specimens should be examined as soon as they are received in the laboratory but if not processed immediately, they should be refrigerated.

__Post analytical errors:__ 

1- Failure to report test results 

2-delay in reporting
