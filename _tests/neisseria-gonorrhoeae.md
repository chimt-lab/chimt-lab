__Sample type:__

-	Body fluid, discharge, pus, swab of genital lesions, or urethral discharge (best for men when available), anus, throat.

__Uses:__

-	Isolate and identify N gonorrhoeae; establish the diagnosis of gonorrhea.

__Precautions:__

-	Do not collect urethral specimens until at least one hour after urinating. 

-	Collection directly from male urethral discharge is desirable. 

-	Collect anorectal specimens from the crypts just inside the anal ring.

-	Endocervix: Swab endocervical canal. Avoid contaminating swab with vaginal secretions. Cultures from the urethra or vagina are indicated from females when endocervical culture is not possible.

-	Urethra: Strip the urethra toward the orifice to express exudate. Use a sterile swab to obtain the specimen.

-	Vagina: Use a speculum, moistened only with warm water, not lubricant. Obtain a specimen from the posterior vaginal vault or from the vaginal orifice if the hymen is intact.

-	Swab samples should be rolled over the surface of the Jembec medium.

__Interfering Factors:__

-	Overgrowth by Proteus and yeast may make it impossible to rule out presence of N gonorrhoeae. 

-	The vancomycin in Thayer-Martin media may inhibit some strains of N gonorrhoeae. 

-	Nongonococcal urethritis may be caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum.

__Pre analytical errors:__

1.	Inappropriate specimen received.

2.	Unlabeled specimen or name discrepancy between specimen and request label;

3.	Specimen received after prolonged delay (usually more than 72 hours); 

4.	Specimen received in expired transport container.

__Corrective action:__

1.	Appropriate specimen received.

2.	Labeled specimen and no name discrepancy between specimen and request label.

3.	Specimen received without delay.

4.	Specimen received in valid transport container.

__Post analytical errors:__

1.	Failure in reporting. 

2.	Erroneous validation of analytical data.

3.	Improper data entry.

__Corrective action:__

1.	Write correct report.

2.	All analytical data should be valid.

3.	Proper data entrty.
