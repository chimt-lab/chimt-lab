__Sample type:__ 

blood sample 

__Uses:__ 

Evaluation of a prolonged thrombin time: It is mainly used to confirm or exclude the presence of heparin in the specimen or specimen type
Evaluating hypofibrinogenemia or dysfibrinogenemia in conjunction with the thrombin time and fibrinogen assay

__Precautions:__ 

1.	Spin down, remove plasma, and spin plasma again.

2. Freeze plasma immediately (no longer than 4 hours after collection) at -20 degrees C, or ideally < or =-40 degrees C.

3. Double-centrifuged specimen is critical for accurate results as platelet contamination may cause spurious results.

4. Each coagulation assay requested should have its own vial.

__Interfering factor:__

-	Prolonged tourniquet constriction, vigorous vein preparation, or excessive pumping of the fist (decrease).

-	Hemolysis due to excessive probing at the venipuncture site or to rough handling of the sample.

-	Failure to place the collection tube and sample on ice

__Pre-analytical errors:__

-	Coagulation samples should not be transported or stored on ice 

-	Coagulation samples for platelet function studies must be maintained at room temperature

__Post analytical errors:__

-	Check instrument settings 

-	Assure that all preventive maintenance has been done 

-	Carry out troubleshooting functions called for in the SOP 

-	Call for equipment support

__Corrective action:__

-	Assure that the prescribed preventive maintenance for the instrument is performed 

__The reference range__

is similar to the Thrombin time and is generally in the range of 13-15s.
