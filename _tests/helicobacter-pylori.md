__Sample type:__ 

Serum (red tube)

__Uses:__

Helicobacter pylori are bacteria that are very common in the general population and the most frequent cause of stomach ulcers. Several tests exist for directly detecting H. pylori bacteria in the stomach (breath tests, stool antigen tests). 

The serology test consists of screening for H. pylori antibodies in the bloodstream. When the antibody screen is negative, it is highly unlikely that the bacteria are present. 

Given how common the bacteria are in the general population and the fact that the antibodies can remain in the bloodstream for decades after the bacteria have disappeared, a positive screen for H. pylori antibodies does not distinguish a current infection requiring antibiotics treatment from a resolved previous infection. A positive antibody screen should therefore be confirmed by a breath or stool antigen test.

__Precaution:__

1)	Don’t smoke or eat anything for 4 hours before the test. Do not take any fluids one hour before test.

2)	Don’t take any antibiotic for two weeks 

3)	If patient taking any of these medications, it is recommended that must discuss his doctor before having the test done.

__Interfering factors:__

1)	False positive results are uncommon except in areas where atrophic gastritis is common, and the test does not include citric acid.

2)	False negative results may be observed in patients who are taking antisecretory therapy, bismuth, or antibiotics and patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. To reduce false negative results, the patient should be off antibiotics for at least four weeks and off PPIs for at least two weeks

__Pre analytical error:__ 

1)	Specimens other than serum; improper labeling; samples not stored properly; samples older than stability limits; gross hemolysis; gross lipemia.

2)	Take sample different from that will analysis it in laboratory. 

3)	Not to put the name of the patient or error when putting the code of patient on the tube when sampling.

4)	Do not record the patient's history in the patient’s profile.

5)	Patient take antibiotics then take the sample from him and technician forget ask him if taking any medication before taking sample from patient 

__Corrective action:__ 

1)	refused the sample and ordered another sample.

2)	The sample should be rejected and order another sample. 

3)	anther sample request and should attention at next time.

4)	Communicating with the patient and recording the patient history.

5)	The sample should be rejected, order another sample and tell patient about medication that shouldn’t be taken 

__Post analytical error:__

1)	Sharing the results of patients or writing the result incorrectly.

2)	write a wrong Patient name   in patient report.

__Corrective action:__

1)	communicate with patient then delivered him the correct results   and   we apologize for this mistake.

2)	the report is not delivered to the patient and the error must be discovered.
