__Sample type: -__

Serum or plasma (EDTA)

__Uses: -__ 

1-	Used clinically to monitor short-term glycemic control in patients with diabetes (1–2 weeks). 

2-	Useful marker for postprandial hyperglycemia. 

3-	Performs better than hemoglobin A1C for monitoring glucose profile in pregnancies complicated by type 1 diabetes.

__Precautions: -__ 

No specific precautions need. 

__Interfere factor: -__ 

-	In patients with poorly controlled DM, 1,5-AG is less sensitive to modest changes in glycemic control because of continuous glycosuria. 

-	Levels can be influenced by factors such as dairy product, races, uric acid, triglycerides, liver disease, gastrectomy state, and cystic fibrosis.

__Pre analytical errors: -__ 

-	If the sample was not collected with the correct instructions, or you received unlabeled sample.

__Corrective action: -__

-	The sample should be rejected, and another sample requested.

__Post analytical error: -__

-	Incorrect calculation

__Corrective action: -__

-	Should read the pamphlet well, then perform the calculation.

-	It is better to perform the calculation more than once to be sure you have the correct result.


__Reference range: -__ 

-	10.7–32.0 μg/mLin males.

-	6.8–29.3 μg/mLin females.

-	Glycemic control goal for diabetic patients: >10
