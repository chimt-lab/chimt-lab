Protein S is a Vitamin K depended protein, synthesized in the liver. It acts in the body as a natural anticoagulant. As co-factor of activated Protein C, it triggers the inactivation of the clotting factors VA and VIIIa.

__Sample type:__

Specimen Frozen plasma Na citrate (Light Blue top tube)

__Uses:__

-	To help investigate the cause of a blood clot (thromboembolism), such as a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE); to determine whether you may have a protein C or protein S deficiency.

-	Sometimes, this test is done to find the cause of repeated miscarriages.

__Precautions:__

-	Anticoagulated a 5-mL venous blood sample with sodium citrate (blue-topped tube).

-	centrifuge, transfer all plasma into a plastic vial, and centrifuge plasma again.

-	Aliquot plasma into a plastic vial leaving 0.25 mL in the bottom of centrifuged vial.

-	Freeze plasma immediately (no longer than 4 hours after collection) at -20° C or, ideally, at ≤-40° c.

-	If the patient is being treated with Coumadin, this should be noted. Coumadin will lower protein C.

-	Heparin (unfractionated or low molecular weight) 2 U/mL or more may interfere with this assay.


__Interfering factors:__

-	Protein S acts as a cofactor for the serine protease Activated Protein C [APC] in the inactivation of Factors VA and VIIIa.

-	A lack (deficiency) of protein S can lead to excess clotting. These clots tend to form in veins, not arteries.

-	A protein S deficiency may be inherited. It can also develop due to pregnancy or certain diseases, including:

-	Disorder in which the proteins that control blood clotting become over active (disseminated intravascular coagulation)

-	HIV/AIDS infection

-	Liver disease

-	Long-term antibiotic use

-	Warfarin (Coumadin) use

-	Protein S level rises with age, but this does not cause any health problems

__Pre analytical errors:__

-	wrong patient preparation

-	Improper tube

-	clotted sample

-	overfilled tube

-	underfilled tube

-	sample received more than 24 hrs after collection

-	mislabeled or unlabeled specimen

__corrective action:__

-	Enquiry before sample collection

-	 Appropriate tube is selected

-	Follow proper order of draw 

-	Blood samples are mixed properly

-	Care is taken during blood collection 

-	Patient’s name with laboratory no

__Post analytical errors:__

-	Incorrect reference values

-	Physician not notified of a panic or critical value

-	Incorrect interpretation of lab results by physician 

-	Incorrect data entry of lab result

__Reference range:__

The reference range for Protein S are:

Males >70-140 U/dL.

Females >60-130 U/dl.

Protein S levels are low at birth [as are all the Vitamin K dependent clotting factors] and do not reach adult values until approximately 6 months of age.
