__Sample type__ 

Serum 

__Use__ 

Screening for chronic iron overload diseases, particularly hereditary hemochromatosis



__Precautions__ 

fasting is preferred from 6-12 hours and before the start of any new treatment 

__Interfering factors__ 

1. Many drugs affect test outcomes 

2. Drugs that may cause increased iron include ethanol, estrogens, and oral contraceptives.

3. Drugs that may cause decreased iron include some antibiotics, aspirin, and testosterone.

4. Hemolysis of the blood sample interferes with testing.

5. Iron contamination of glassware used in testing can give high values.

6. Menstruation causes decreased iron; iron is elevated in the premenstrual period.

7. There is a diurnal variation in iron: normal values in the morning, lower in midafternoon, very low in the evening. 

8. Serum iron and TIBC may be normal in iron-deficiency anemia if the Hb is >9.0 g/dL (or >90 g/L).

9. Lipemic specimens are not recommended since they may cause negative bias.

Pathological albumin levels more than 7 g/dl decrease the TIBC levels. 


__Pre analytical errors__ 

1- Incorrect Analysis ordered 

2- patients identification error

3- sample collection errors 

__Corrective action__ 

1- Using appropriate technology.

2- Monitoring quality indicators in the lab.

3- Choosing appropriate products. 

__Post analytical errors__ 

1- Report delayed 

2- Not all requested tests done 

3- Sharing the results of patients or writing the result incorrectly. 

__Corrective action__ 

1- Done Accurate Reports after doing tests 

2- Assure that the prescribed preventive maintenance for the instruments is performed 

3- Attention when delivered the results  of patient and write them in the reports
