 - Vaginal candidiasis caused by fungal infection with Candida albicans.

 - Bacterial vaginosis caused by an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria, particularly Gardnerella vaginalis.

 - Trichomoniasis, a sexually transmitted infection caused by the protozoan Trichomoniasis vaginalis (TV). 

- Endocervical infections caused by Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae may cause vaginal discharge or other symptoms such as; dysuria, post coital/intermenstrual bleeding, deep dyspareunia, pelvic pain and tenderness (if there is ascending pelvic infection), or reactive arthritis.
