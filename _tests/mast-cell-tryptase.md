Tryptase is an enzyme that is released, along with histamine and other chemicals, from mast cells when they are activated as part of a normal immune response as well as in allergic (hypersensitivity) responses. This test measures the amount of tryptase in the blood.

__Sample Type:__

Blood Sample (serum)

__Uses:__

Useful for assessing mast cell activation, which may occur as a result of anaphylaxis, or allergen challenge, or in patients with systemic mastocytosis or mast cell activation syndrome.

__Precautions:__

For suspected anaphylaxis samples should be taken as soon as possible after emergency treatment, 1-2 hours post treatment (but no later than 4 hours post) and a baseline sample at >24 hrs post treatment. 

__Special precautions:__

 For suspected anaphylaxis the first sample should be obtained as soon as possible after the patient's condition has been stabilised

__Interfering factors:__

-	the level of tryptase in the blood is very low When mast cells are activated.

-	the level increases rapidly, rising within 15 to 30 minutes, peaking at 1 to 2 hours, and returning to normal after several hours to a couple of days. In people with severe allergies, activation of many mast cells can cause an extreme form of allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis, which can cause low blood pressure, hives (blisters on the skin), severe narrowing of the air passages, and even death. Tryptase levels will be very high in people with anaphylaxis.

__Pre-Analytical errors:__

-	wrong patient preparation

-	Improper tube

-	clotted sample

-	overfilled tube

-	underfilled tube

-	sample received more than 24 hrs after collection

-	mislabeled or unlabeled specimen

__Corrective Action:__

-	Enquiry before sample collection

-	 Appropriate tube is selected

-	Follow proper order of draw 

-	Blood samples are mixed properly

-	Care is taken during blood collection

-	Patientâ€™s name with laboratory no

__Post Analytical errors:__

-	incorrect reference values

-	Physician not notified of a panic or critical value

-	Incorrect interpretation of lab results by physician

-	 Incorrect data entry of lab result
