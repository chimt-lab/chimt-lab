__Sample type:__ 

blood sample , rarely a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample or an amniotic fluid sample is collected from a pregnant woman using amniocentesis

__Uses:__ 

A toxoplasmosis test is used to detect a current or past infection with the microscopic parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Most often it may be performed for:

-	A woman prior to or during a pregnancy to determine if she has been previously exposed to Toxoplasma Gondi and during a pregnancy if exposure is suspected

-	An individual who has a weakened immune system (immunocompromised) and has flu-like symptoms

-	A person who has signs or symptoms of toxoplasmosis

-	An unborn baby, in which case, amniotic fluid may be tested

__Precautions:__

-	Pregnant women should be discouraged from working with the Toxoplasma species.

-	Protective clothing should be worn by workers exposed to contaminated materials. Contaminated clothing should be labelled with a biohazard warning and washed using laundry procedures for disinfection.

-	Production and exposure to aerosols from animal tissues should be minimized.

__Interfering factor:__

No interfering factor in this test 

__pre analytical error :__ 

1-sample identification errors, 

insufficient no. of requisitions or 

samples 

 __corrective action :__ 
 
To compare identifiers such as the patientâ€™s name and his or her unique ID. Integration of bar code 
Technology, Computerization .

__pre analytical error:__  

quality of the sample

__corrective action:__ 

2-Hemolysed/Lipemic/Icterus samples 

may be run as per the discretion.


__Post analytical errors:__

-	Processing of results for transcription onto report forms

-	Reduce human error through root-cause analysis, process control, and education/communication.
