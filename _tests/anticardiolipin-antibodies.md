__-->	Sample type:__

Serum.

__-->	Uses:__

Anticardiolipin antibodies are often present in individuals with the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.

__-->	Precautions:__

This assay is a diagnostic aid. A definite clinical diagnosis should not be based on the results of a single test, but should be made by the physician after all clinical and laboratory findings have been evaluated concerning the entire clinical picture of the patient. Also every decision for therapy should be taken individually.

__-->	Interfering Factors:__

1) A variety of therapeutic drugs can induce the production of ACA.

2) Low levels of these antibodies may be present in those with HIV, certain types of cancer and infections, the elderly, and individuals on drugs such as phenothiazines and procainamide.

__-->	Pre analytical errors:__

1) Error in dilution of sample.

2) Expose the substrate solution to light

__-->	Corrective action:__

All patients who test positive for ACA should be retested after six to eight weeks to rule out transient antibodies that are usually of no clinical significance.

__-->	Post analytical errors:__

1) Failure in reporting.

2) Erroneous validation of analytical data.

3) Improper data entry.

__-->	Reference range:__

In a normal range study with samples from healthy blood donors the following ranges have been established with this ELISA assay: Cut-off 10 U/ml Interpretation of results 

Negative: < 10 U/ml

Positive: â‰¥ 10 U/ml
