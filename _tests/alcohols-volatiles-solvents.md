__Sample type: -__

Urine (random)

__Uses: -__

1.	Beverage (ethanol).

2.	Solvent and reagent.

3.	Vehicle in chemical and pharmaceutical industries,

4.	Antiseptic (isopropyl alcohol).

__Precautions: -__

Urine tests can detect alcohol in your system much longer after you've consumed alcohol. On average, a urine test could detect alcohol between 12 to 48 hours after drinking. Some advanced urine tests can detect alcohol even 80 hours after you've had a drink. Alcohol can stay in your hair for a period of up to 90 days.

__Interfere factor: -__

1.	Immunoassay testing for ethanol may have cross-reactivity <1% with isopropanol alcohol, methanol, ethylene glycol, and acetaldehyde; <15% with n-propanol.

2.	Elevated concentrations of acetone are detected in specimens during diabetic ketoacidosis is and fasting ketoacidosis and may range from 10 to 70 mg/dL.

3.	In many headspaces gas chromatographic methods, acetonitrile coelutes with acetone, leading to a false-positive result. Acetonitrile may be a component in cosmetic nail remover.

4.	A positive urine ethanol due to the presence of yeast in the patient’s urine has been described. In these cases, glucose was also present in the urine.

__Pre analytical error: -__

-	Exchange the sample with another liquid.

__Corrective action: -__

-	Check the sample before receiving it.

__Post analytical error: -__

-	Wrong labeling and delivered to another patient.

__Corrective action: -__

-	Be careful when submission the result.

-	If the result is not delivered yet, ask to change it. 

__Reference range: -__

-->	Ethanol: <10 mg/dL.

-	50 mg/dL: decreased inhibition, slight incoordination.

-	100 mg/dL: slow reaction time; altered sensory ability.

-	150 mg/dL: altered thought processes; personality, behavior changes.

-	200 mg/dL: staggering gait, nausea, vomiting, mental confusion.

-	300 mg/dL: slurred speech, sensory loss, visual disturbance.

-	400 mg/dL: hypothermia, hypoglycemia, poor muscle control, seizures.

-	700 mg/dL: unconsciousness, decreased reflexes, respiratory failure (may also occur at lower concentrations).

-->	Isopropanol (isopropyl alcohol): <10 mg/dL (normal); toxic effects generally seen at 50–100 mg/dL.

-->	Methanol: <10 mg/dL(normal); levels >25 mg/dLare generally considered toxic.

-->	 Acetone: <10 mg/dL; effects are said to be like ethanol for similar blood levels, but the anesthetic potency is greater.
