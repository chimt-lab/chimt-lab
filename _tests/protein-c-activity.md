Protein C and protein S usually indicate adequate clotting regulation. Low protein C or protein S level or activity indicates blood clotting is not sufficiently regulated and there is an increased risk of developing a clot that blocks the flow of blood in the veins.

__-	Sample type:__

Specimen Type:

Platelet-poor plasma

Collection Container/Tube: Light-blue top (3.2% sodium citrate)

__-	Uses:__

 
Provides important control of blood coagulation by regulating the activities of factor VIIIa (FVIIIa) and factor VA (FVa), cofactors in the activation of factor X and prothrombin, respectively.

__-	Precaution:__

1. If the patient is being treated with Coumadin, this should be noted. Coumadin will lower protein C.

2. Heparin (unfractionated or low molecular weight) 2 U/mL or more may interfere with this assay.

__-	Interfering factors:__

Activated protein C (aPC) is a natural anticoagulant due to its actions that proteolytically inactivate clotting factors VA and VIIIa. APC is generated after an interaction of protein C with thrombin, bound to the endothelial cell surface protein thrombomodulin.

__-	Pre analytical errors:__

1)	Sample collection 

2)	Needle size,

3)	Collection tubes

4)	Sample delivery to the laboratory

__-	Corrective action:__

(i)	For complete instructions, see Coagulation Guidelines for Specimen Handling and Processing. Centrifuge, transfer all plasma into a plastic vial, and centrifuge plasma again.

(ii)	Aliquot plasma into a plastic vial leaving 0.25 mL in the bottom of centrifuged vial.

(iii)	. Freeze plasma immediately (no longer than 4 hours after collection) at -20 degrees C or, ideally, at < or =-40 degrees C.

__-	Post analytical errors:__

a)	Evaluation of test results

b)	Decision to release test results

c)	Preparation of the laboratory test report

d)	Release of the laboratory test report

e)	Reporting of test results

__-	Reference rang:__

The normal range of protein C activity in healthy adults is between 65 to 135 IU dL-1. Patients with mild protein C deficiency have activity levels between 20 IU dL-1 and the lower limit of normal values, as determined by age.
