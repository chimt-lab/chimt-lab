__sample type:__

whole blood (lithium heparin) 

__uses:__ 

The osmotic fragility test may also be used to help confirm if thalassemia or spherocytosis is the cause of anemia. By measure RBCs resistance to hemolysis when exposed to a series of increasingly dilute saline solution 

__Precaution:__ 

-	Is recommended that testing should be done within two hours after collection. If the test cannot be performed within this time frame, the blood should be refrigerated. Osmotic fragility testing can be adversely affected by temperature and pH. Hemolyzed sample should not be used. 

-	Must be sampling on lithium heparin 

-	Knowing type of test Immediate test or 24-hour incubation 

__interfering factors:__ 

Osmotic fragility of red cells is increased by the use of mefenamic acid. The use of this analgesic induces hemolytic anemia. Study of osmotic fragility of RBCs of control and test was observed following administration of 7.1 mg, 10.5 mg and 14 mg/day mefenamic acid to each lizard. Increased osmotic fragility was observed with increase in the amount of dose on day 6 and day 12. The test is incubated at 37Â°C for 24 hours, at which time the test is positive for hereditary spherocytosis

__Pre analytical error:__ 

Using another type of anticoagulant tube other than heparin due to  heparin maintains the morphology of the cell for a long period. Put a large amount of the sample in the tube (above the mark on the tube). Some patients take medications that help increase osmotic fragility test.

__Corrective action:__ 

Use lithium heparin tube (green tube). Prevent the patient from taking this drug  for a week before doing the analysis


__Post analytical error:__ 

Changing the results due to the exchange of patients' names. Writing false results in report 

Corrective action: 

Use codes that contain all patient data or write the patient's name correctly 

__Reference range:__ 

-	Immediate test: Hemolysis begins at 0.5% NaCl Hemolysis complete at 0.3% NaCl

-	24-hour incubation: Hemolysis begins at 0.7% NaCl Hemolysis complete at 0.4% NaCl
