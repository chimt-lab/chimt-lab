__Sample type:__

Whole Blood EDTA 

__Uses:__

 A hemoglobin test is often used to check for anemia , a condition in which your body has fewer red blood cells than normal. If you have anemia, the cells in your body don't get all the oxygen they need. Hemoglobin tests are measured as part of a  compete blood count (CBC). Hemoglobin is Screening tool to confirm a hematologic disorder, to establish or rule out a diagnosis, to detect an unsuspected hematologic disorder, or to monitor effects of radiation or chemotherapy 

__Precaution:__

-	 Patient can eat and drink normally before the test. If the blood sample will be used for other tests, you may need to fast for a certain amount of time before the sample is taken.  

-	Must be sampling on EDITA tube 

-	Sample shouldnâ€™t be hemolyezed because will be affecting on the result of hemoglobin
 
__Interfering Factors:__ 

1. People living at high altitudes have increased Hb values as well as increased Hct and RBC.

2. Excessive fluid intake causes a decreased Hb.

3. Normally, the Hb is higher in infants (before active erythropoiesis begins).

4. Hb is normally decreased in pregnancy as a result of increased plasma volume.

5. There are many drugs that may cause a decreased Hb. Drugs that may cause an increased Hb include gentamicin
and methyldopa.

6. Extreme physical exercise causes increased Hb. 

__Pre analytical errors:__ 

 The clotting of blood after collection or during collection is found to be major cause of rejection of blood sample. Not doing exercise before this test 

__Corrective action:__ 

Fill the EDITA tube by blood at the mark on the tube and do gently mix. Mixing of the sample before loading it into the analyzer is common, automated blood sample mixing is a standardized and time saving approach.. Advice the patient not doing exercise before sampling 

__Post analytical errors:__ 

Changing the results due to the exchange of patients' names  

__Corrective action:__ 

Use codes that contain all patient data or write the patient's name correctly 

__Reference range:__ 

Male: 13.8 to 17.2 (g/dL)

Female: 12.1 to 15.1 g/dL
