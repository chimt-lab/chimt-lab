__Sample type:__

-	Lavender-top (EDTA) tube.

__Uses:__

-	Evaluate, diagnose, and/or follow up bleeding disorders, drug-induced thrombocytopenia, idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura (acute or chronic), disseminated intravascular coagulation, leukemia states,

-	 Chemotherapeutic management of malignant disease states; investigate purpura, petechiae; 

-	Evaluate response to platelet transfusions, steroids, or other therapy.

__Precautions:__

-	Maintain specimen at room temperature.

-	Avoid strenuous activity, contact sports,lifting heavy objects, training to cough, forceful nose blowing, or constipation.

-	Avoid medications that affect blood clotting

-	Donâ€™t take aspirin or any product that contains aspirin.

__Interfering Factors:__

-	Clumping may cause false low count.

-	Platelet satellitism around neutrophils will cause a pseudothrombocytopenia. 

-	RBC or WBC fragments including fragmented fragile leukemic cells and neutrophil pseudoplatelets2 may cause falsely elevated counts.

__Pre analytical errors:__

1.	Inappropriate specimen received.

2.	Unlabeled specimen or name discrepancy between specimen and request label;

3.	Specimen received after prolonged delay (usually more than 72 hours); 

4.	Specimen received in expired transport container.

__Corrective action:__

1.	Appropriate specimen received.

2.	Labeled specimen and no name discrepancy between specimen and request label.

3.	Specimen received without delay.

4.	Specimen received in valid transport container.

__Post analytical errors:__

1.	Failure in reporting. 

2.	Erroneous validation of analytical data.

3.	Improper data entry.

__Corrective action:__

1.	Write correct report.

2.	All analytical data should be valid.

3.	Proper data entry.

__Reference range:__

-	A normal platelet count ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood.
