__Sample type__

Serum

__Uses__

1-Biomarker for body fat metabolism

__Precautions__ 

No special precaution required

__Interfering factor__

1-Serum leptin concentrations increase with progressive obesity. The concentrations are higher in women than in men, for any measure of obesity, and they decrease with age in both women and men.

2-Pregnant women have higher serum leptin concentrations than nonpregnant women.

3-Serum leptin concentrations increase during childhood, with the highest concentrations in children who gain the most weight; higher serum leptin concentrations are associated with an earlier onset of puberty.

4-The concentrations are similar in normal subjects and patients of the same weight with type2 DM

__Pre analytical errors__

1-Pregnancy affect leptin concentration

__Corrective action__

Taking history of beginning of  pregnancy

2-Metabolic disease affect leptin concentration 

__Corrective action__

Taking history of disease of the patient

__Post-analytical errors__ 

1- Write another patient's name on the report

__The corrective action__

Make sure you write the correct name on the report

2-Writing a wrong result in the report

__The corrective action__

If the report is not delivered to the patient and this error is discovered
the correct result must be written, but if the report is delivered to the 
patient, must communicate with him and tell him that an error has occurred 
and replace the report with the report in which there is the correct result.

__Reference range__

Male: 0.5–12.7 ng/mL

Female: 3.9–30.0 ng/mL
