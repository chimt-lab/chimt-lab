__Sample type__

Serum (Red-top tube or gel-barrier tube)

__Uses__

1.	Diagnosis of insulinoma 

2.	Diagnosis of fasting hypoglycemia

3.	Not clinically useful for diagnosis of diabetes mellitus

__Precautions__

You will probably need to fast (not eat or drink) for eight hours before the test.

__Interfering factors__

Circulating anti-insulin antibodies are often found in patients who have been treated with nonhuman forms of insulin. If present, these antibodies may interfere with the assay.

For individuals who are significantly overweight, fasting insulin levels are typically somewhat higher than for adults of normal weight. 

Heterophilic antibodies in human serum can react with the immunoglobulins included in the assay components, causing interference with in vitro immunoassays. Samples from patients routinely exposed to animals or animal serum products can demonstrate this type of interference, potentially causing an anomalous result.

__Pre-analytical errors__

1- Citrate plasma specimen; hemolyzed specimen

__The corrective action__

The sample must be rejected and another sample be obtained.

__Post-analytical errors__ 

1-reports were sent to the incorrect patient

2-write the wrong name in the report or the wrong results.

__The corrective action__

1-communication with patient, apologising for the error, and providing him with the correct report

2-If the report is not delivered to the patient and this error is discovered, the correct result or the correct name must be written, but if the report is delivered to the patient, you must communicate with him, apologise to him, and tell him that an error has occurred and replace it with the correct report.

__Reference Range__

 6–27 μIU/mL
