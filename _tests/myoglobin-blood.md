__Sample type__

Serum

__Uses__

-	Diagnose skeletal or myocardial muscle injury.

-	Serum myoglobin is generally detectable earlier than is CK or CK-MB increase in patients with acute myocardial infarction. 

-	Diagnose rhabdomyolysis.

-	Myoglobin appears with trauma, ischemia, malignant hyperthermia, exertion, dermatomyositis, polymyositis, and muscular dystrophy.

__Precautions__

This test may exhibit interference when sample is collected from a person who is consuming a supplement with a high dose of biotin (also termed as vitamin B7 or B8, vitamin H, or coenzyme R).

It is recommended to ask all patients who may be indicated for this test about biotin supplementation. 

Patients should be cautioned to stop biotin consumption at least 72 hours prior to the collection of a sample.

__Interfering factors__

-	Additional enzymes that may be elevated include LDH and aspartate aminotransferase.

-	Additional electrolyte abnormalities in patients with may release muscle cell contents into the blood, including hyperphosphatemia and hyperkalemia. Furthermore, hypercalcemia may develop as a result of hyperphosphatemia or deposition of calcium in damaged muscle cells.

-	Serum uric acid may increase, and metabolic acidosis may occur as a result of acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria

__Pre-analytical errors__

wrong tube, missed request/ QNS (Quantity Not Sufficient)

__The corrective action__

Request to resend a new draw. Microtainers, micro tubes and advanced analyzers reduce the minimum volume required for assay. Documentation and reporting the same to concerned collection area to increase the awareness on preanalytical errors

__Post-analytical errors__

1.	Data entry errors 

__The corrective action__

Overcoming clerical errors 

2.	Reporting delays 

__The corrective action__

Dedicated person for stat reporting and critical alerts 

SMS alert when report is ready
