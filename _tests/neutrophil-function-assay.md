__Sample type__ 

WB Sodium Heparin

__Uses__

1.	The dihydrorhodamine (DHR) test has the ability to assess neutrophil superoxide production, a risk indicator for serious infection. Diagnosis of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD).

__Precautions__ 

1.	Do NOT centrifuge sample  Keep at room temperature (18-22°C).

2.	Unacceptable Conditions :- Frozen, clotted, hemolyzed or centrifuged specimens. Anticoagulants other than heparin. Specimens >48 hrs old.

3.	Specimens are optimally tested within 24 hours of blood draw, though the stability of the assay is within 48 hours of collection. Specimens should be collected in sodium heparin.

__Interfering factors__ 

Hemolyzed specimens may give high background. Specimens with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) below 200 will not be accepted for this assay. Complete myeloperoxidase (MPO) deficiency can yield a false-positive result.

__Pre analytical errors__ 

1.	Factors affecting the test :- Temperature, delay in processing and sample type 

__Corrective action__ 

1.	Keep and transport the sample at room temperature. 

2.	Use the corrective anticoagulant for the sample.

__Post analytical errors__

1.	reporting to the wrong health care provider

2.	delay of the delivery of the results

 __Corrective action__ 

1.	Critical results must be reported within 30 minutes time of obtaining results.

2.	The result is reported to the pathologist and then called to the ordering physician.
