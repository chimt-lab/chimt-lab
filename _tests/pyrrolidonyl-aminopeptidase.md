  __Uses:__

1)	It is used for the presumptive identification of group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes).

2)	It is used for the rapid differentiation of enterococci from group D ÃŸ-hemolytic streptococci.

3)	It also differentiate some Staphylococci (positive haemolyticus from negative S. auricularis).

4)	Sample type: Colonies from pure culture. 

5)	Precautions: sterile the loop 

6)	And don't take any sample without label. 

  __Interfering factors:__

1)	A false-negative test can result if the disk or filter paper are too moist.

2)	False-negative tests can result if selective media or tube biochemical agars are used to provide inocula.

3)	Escherichia coli and indole-positive Proteus  obtained from media containing a high tryptophan content may yield a blue-green color development. This is a negative result.

4)	Some less commonly encountered isolates of lactococci and aerococci may be PYRase positive.

5)	Non-specific colour reactions may occur if results are read after 20 seconds.
