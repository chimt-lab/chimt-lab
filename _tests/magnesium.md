__Sample type__

Serum

__Uses__

1-Diagnosis and monitoring of hypomagnesemia and hypermagnesemia, especially in renal failure or GI disorders. 

2-To monitor preeclampsia patients being treated with magnesium sulfate, although in most cases, monitoring clinical signs (respiratory rate and deep tendon reflexes) is adequate, and blood magnesium levels are not required

__Precautions__

No special precaution required

__Interferring factor__

1-Serum magnesium levels may remain normal even when total body stores of magnesium are depleted up to 20%.

2-Phylate, fatty acids, and an excess of phosphate impair Mg absorption.

3-Hemolysis yields elevated results because levels in erythrocytes are two to three times higher than in serum

__Pre analytical error__

1-hemolysis give incorrect results. 

__Corrective action__

1-reject the sample and require another one.

__Post-analytical errors__

1-Writing a wrong result or wrong name in the report

2-report were sent to incorrect patient

__The corrective actions__

1- If the report is not delivered to the patient and this error is discovered the correct result or the correct name must be written, but if the report is delivered to the patient must communicate with him and tell him that an error has occurred and replace with the correct report.

2-Communicate with patient ,apologizing for the error, and providing him with the correct report
