__Sample type:__

-	EDTA.

__Uses:__

An absolute eosinophil count is a blood test that measures the number of one type of white blood cells called eosinophils. Eosinophils become active when you have certain allergic diseases, infections, and other medical conditions.

You will have this test to see if you have abnormal results from a blood differential test. This test may also be done if the provider thinks you may have a specific disease.

__This test may help diagnose:__

-	Acute hypereosinophilic syndrome (a rare, but sometimes fatal leukemia-like condition)

-	An allergic reaction (can also reveal how severe the reaction is)

-	Early stages of Addison disease

-	Infection by a parasite

-	Vasculitis

__Precautions:__

-	Avoid taking alcohol before the test.

-	Avoid some certain steroids medications

__Interfering Factors:__

Medicines that may cause you to have an increase in eosinophils include:

-	Amphetamines (appetite suppressants).

-	Certain laxatives containing psyllium.

-	Certain antibiotics.

-	Interferon.

-	Tranquilizers.

__Pre analytical errors:__

1.	Inappropriate specimen received.

2.	Unlabeled specimen or name discrepancy between specimen and request label;

3.	Specimen received after prolonged delay (usually more than 72 hours); 

4.	Specimen received in expired transport container.

__Corrective action:__

1.	Appropriate specimen received.

2.	Labeled specimen and no name discrepancy between specimen and request label.

3.	Specimen received without delay.

4.	Specimen received in valid transport container.

__Post analytical errors:__

1.	Failure in reporting. 

2.	Erroneous validation of analytical data.

3.	Improper data entry.

__Corrective action:__

1.	Write correct report.

2.	All analytical data should be valid.

3.	Proper data entry.

__Reference range:__

-	Normal eosinophil count is less than 500 cells per microliter (cells/mcL).
