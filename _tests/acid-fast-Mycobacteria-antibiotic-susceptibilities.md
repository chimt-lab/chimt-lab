---


__Sample type:__

-	Isolated mycobacteria from primary clinical specimen on media slant or in broth.

__Uses:__

-	Determine the susceptibility of the isolated organism to a profile of antimycobacterial agents.

__Precautions:__

-	Susceptibilities should be performed on the first organism isolated from a patient, and at one- to three-month intervals if that organism continues to be isolated while the patient is on therapy.

-	Susceptibility tests should be performed in patients with recurrent tuberculosis as resistant strains are common in recurrent infection.

__Interfering Factors:__

-	Susceptibilities cannot be reported if the organism fails to grow on test media and give false negative.

__Pre analytical errors:__

1.	Inappropriate specimen received.

2.	Unlabeled specimen or name discrepancy between specimen and request label;

3.	Specimen received after prolonged delay (usually more than 72 hours); 

4.	Specimen received in expired transport container.

__Corrective action:__

1.	Appropriate specimen received.

2.	Labeled specimen and no name discrepancy between specimen and request label.

3.	Specimen received without delay.

4.	Specimen received in valid transport container.

__Post analytical errors:__

1.	Failure in reporting. 

2.	Erroneous validation of analytical data.

3.	Improper data entry.

__Corrective action:__

1.	Write correct report.

2.	All analytical data should be valid.

3.	Proper data entrty.
