__Sample type__

Serum 

Plasma (heparin)

__Uses__

ASA and salicylate have analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory properties; used in the treatment of RA (Rheumatoid Arthritis).

ASA also inhibits platelet aggregation and, therefore, prolongs bleeding time.

__Precautions__

No specific precautions needed for this test.

__Interfering factors__

- Sulfasalazine at elevated levels (300 mg/L) may lead to falsely high result.

 - Sulfapyridine at elevated levels (300 mg/L) may lead to falsely low result. 

- Salicylate blood levels do not correlate well with degree of toxicity in chronic salicylism.  

- Other drugs may displace protein-bound salicylate leading to increase toxicity. 

- Salicylate doses inpatients on chronic therapy may approach toxic levels.

- Hemolysis

- Lipemia

- Icteric sample

__Pre-analytical errors__

1- unlabeled specimen, hemolysis sample,icteric sample.

2-If the sample is grossly lipemic after centrifugate it.

__The corrective actions__

1-The sample should be rejected and another sample requested

2-Centrifuge the sample again, If the sample still has lipemia, reject this sample and another sample will be requested.


__Post-analytical errors__

1-Writing a wrong result or wrong name in the report

2-report were sent to incorrect patient

__The corrective actions__

1- If the report is not delivered to the patient and this error is discovered, the correct result or the correct name must be written, but if the report is delivered to the patient, you must communicate with the patient, apologise to him, and tell him that an error has occurred and replace it with the correct report.

2-Communicate with patient ,apologizing for the error, and providing him with the correct report.

__Reference range__

Therapeutic concentration: 15 - 30 mg/dL
