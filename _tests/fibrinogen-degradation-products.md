---


 Are fragments released following plasmin-mediated degradation of fibrinogen or fibrin.The d-dimer is a specific fragment formed only upon degradation of cross-linked fibrin.

__-	Sample type:__

Plasma, Container. Blue-top (sodium citrate) tube.

__-	Uses:__

 Commonly used to aid in the diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

__-	Precautions:__ 

a)	Some drugs like warfarin and other oral anticoagulants decrease the value.

b)	Avoid the excessive agitation of the blood.

c)	Avoid prolonged use of a tourniquet.

d)	Some of the drugs may affect and increase the level of FDPs like .heparin was given to treat the blood clots.

__-	Interfering factors:__

-	Increased FDP  Level Is Seen In:

-	Myocardial infarction.

-	Heart or vascular surgery.

-	Thrombosis.

-	Pulmonary embolism.

-	Thrombolytic or defibrination therapy.

-	Primary and secondary fibrinolysis.

-	In the case of DIC.

-	Pregnancy

-	Decreased FDP Value Seen In: Anticoagulant therapy.

__-	Pre analytical errors:__

i.	Sample collection 

ii.	Needle size,

iii.	Collection tubes

iv.	Sample delivery to the laboratory

v.	Temperature

vi.	Sample processing (e.g. centrifugation, hemolysis samples).

__-	Corrective action:__

vii.	It is done in the serum.

viii.	Collect 2 ml blood in a test tube containing Thrombin, soybean, and Trypsin inhibitor.

ix.	Allow to clot at 37 Â°C for 30 min

x.	 Keep in mind that drugs like barbiturates, streptokinase, urokinase, and heparin may increase the Test validation
