__Sample type:__ 

Serum (Red tube)

 __Uses :__

 Evaluation of gonadal hormonal function, because Testosterone is the major androgenic hormone. It is responsible for the development of the male external genitalia and secondary sexual characteristics. In females, its main role is as an estrogen precursor. In both genders, it also exerts anabolic effects and influences behavior. 

__Precautions__ 

- Sample should be on red tube, Serum gel/SST are not acceptable .

- Testosterone testing should be performed between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m .which is around when levels are normally the highest. 

Some doctors may require you to prepare for the test by fasting, which means avoiding eating or drinking anything but water for a few hours before the test.  

- It's very important to know patient's age and sex.

-It's preferred to collect specimen in the morning. 

__Interfering factors__

Early-morning testosterone levels in young male individuals are, on average, 50% higher than p.m. levels. Reference values were established using specimens collected in the morning

- free testosterone measurements by calculation using algorithms based on the law of mass action, which require total testosterone, SHBG ,and albumin concentration have excellent correlations with physical separation measures. 


__Pre-analytical errors__ 

1 – unlabeled or mislabeled specimen 

2 – if the sample was hemolysis or lipemic .

__The Corrective action__ 

Reject  the sample and another one is obtained.

Reject the sample and another sample is obtained 

__Post analytical errors__ 

 send wrong results to the patient .

__The Corrective action__ 

 you must communicate with the patient and apologize for this mistake and sent the right report
