The primary clinical use of LH measurement is in evaluating the normalcy of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Measurement of serum gonadotropin levels will allow for distinguishing between primary gonadal failure and deficient gonadal stimulation. LH measurement may also be of clinical importance because growth hormone and LH are frequently the first hormones to be affected by pituitary disease. The serum analysis of LH has also been found to be very useful in the diagnosis and treatment of infertility in women
