__Sample type:__

usually a blood test, but may also be given as a 24-hour urine test, or as a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis.

__Uses:__

-	Figure out the severity of cancer and whether it has spread. This process is known as cancer staging. 

-	Predict disease development and guide treatment.

-	See if cancer treatment is effective.

-	See if cancer has spread to the brain Provides a useful indicator of prognosis and can be used to follow disease progression in Plasma cell myeloma.

-	Limited application in the detection of dialysis Amyloidosis and in monitoring glomerular filtration in renal disease.

-	most often given to people who have been diagnosed with certain cancers of the bone marrow or and spinal cord.

-	Beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) test is used as a tumour marker for some blood cell cancers. It is not diagnostic for a specific disease, but it has been associated with the amount of cancer present (tumour burden).

-	A B2M test may also be requested to help determine the severity and spread (stage) of multiple myeloma and may sometimes be requested to evaluate disease activity and the effectiveness of treatment. 

-	Rarely, a CSF B2M test may be requested to assess central nervous system involvement.

-	Find out if a viral infection, such as HIV/AIDS, has affected the brain and/or spinal cord.

-	Check to see if disease has advanced in people with multiple sclerosis, a chronic disease affecting the brain and spinal cord.                            




__Precaution:__ 

BLOODTEST, health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. 

__For a 24-hour urine sample,__ 

-	A 24-hour urine sample test usually includes the following steps:

-	Empty your bladder in the morning and flush that urine away.

-	Record the time For the next 24 hours.

-	save all your urine in the container provided. 

-	Store your urine container in the refrigerator or a cooler with ice.

-	Return the sample container to your health provider's office or the laboratory as instructed.

__For a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis,__

-	a sample of spinal fluid will be collected in a procedure called a spinal tap (also known as a lumbar puncture).  

-	spinal tap is done in a hospital. 

-	You will lie on your side or sit on an exam table.

-	A health care provider will clean your back and inject an anesthetic into your skin, 

-	Your provider may put a numbing cream on your back before this injection.

-	Once the area on your back is completely numb, your provider will insert a thin, hollow needle between two vertebrae in your lower spine.

__Interference:__

.Expose to cadmium or mercury lead to elevate B2M level.

-	Severe infections, viral infections such as CMV (cytomegalovirus), and some conditions that activate the immune system, such as inflammatory conditions and autoimmune disorders, can cause increases in beta-2 microglobulin levels.

-	Drugs such as lithium, cyclosporine, cisplatin, carboplatin, gentamicin, interferon-Î±, and aminoglycoside antibiotics can increase B2M blood and/or urine concentrations.

-	B2M is increased in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD).     

-	Recent nuclear medicine procedures and radiographic contrast media can affect test results.

__Pre-analytical error:__

Collect the sample in a non-sterile tube. Gross hemolysis,mislabeled or unlabeled specimens

__The Corrective action:__

The sample should be rejected and another sample requested.

__Post-analytical error:__

reports were sent to the incorrect patient.

__The corrective action:__

communication with patient, apologising for the error, and providing him with the correct report.

__Reference range__

REFERENCE RANGE: < 60 years: 0.8-2.5 mg/L> 60 years: 0.8-3.0 mg/L.
