Rotavirus commonly causes severe, watery diarrhea and vomiting in infants and young children. Children may become dehydrated and need to be hospitalized and can even die.
Protect your child with rotavirus vaccine.

__sample type:__

Two types of fecal specimens used for the diagnosis of rotavirus are bulk or whole-stool specimens (collected from a diaper or a collection cup) and rectal swabs.

__Uses:__

The rotavirus test is a stool test used to diagnose a rotavirus infection. Rotavirus affects the intestines and causes vomiting and diarrhea. This infection is especially common in young children, but it can affect adults, too.

__Precaution:__

Using Rectal swab.  doctor slowly inserts a small swab into rectum until it reaches the back Theyâ€™ll move it around gently to gather a sample of secretions, then slowly remove it.

__Interfering factors:__

At bivariate analysis, breastfeeding, dehydration, age below 2 years and high education level (secondary and above) were significantly associated with rotavirus diarrhea.

__Pre analytical errors:__

1. Erros in patient preparation

2. specimen transportation

3. specimen collection

__corrective action:__

Rotavirus can be detected in stool specimens from children with gastroenteritis by several techniques, including electron microscopy, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, antigen detection assays, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and virus isolation

__Post analytical errors:__

1- failure to report test results

2-delay in reporting
