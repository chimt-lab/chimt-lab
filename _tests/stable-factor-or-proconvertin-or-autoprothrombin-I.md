The factor VII assay is a blood test to measure the activity of factor VII. This is one of the proteins in the body that helps the blood clot.

__Sample type:__

Whole blood Light Blue top (Buffered Na Citrate)

__Uses:__

Useful for the detection of a single factor congenital homozygous or heterozygous deficiency or an acquired deficiency due to a lack of Vitamin K or liver disease and evaluate an isolated prolonged PT

__Precautions:__

-	Patient should not be receiving heparin. If so, this should be noted on the request form. Heparin therapy can affect certain coagulation factors.

-	 Patients with a hematocrit level >55% must have a special tube made to adjust for the hematocrit; contact lab for a special tube.

-	Must be tested within 4 hours.

-	Avoid Coumadin for two weeks and heparin therapy for two days prior to the test.

__Interfering factors:__

Decreased factor VII activity may be related to:

-	Factor VII deficiency (a bleeding disorder that affects the ability of blood to clot)

-	Disorder in which the proteins that control blood clotting become over active (disseminated intravascular coagulation)

-	Fat malabsorption (not absorbing enough fat from your diet)

-	Liver disease (such as cirrhosis)

-	Vitamin K deficiency

-	Taking blood thinners

__Pre analytical errors:__

-	Gross hemolysis

-	 clotted specimen

-	frozen specimen 

-	 improper labeling

__Corrective action:__

-	Good mixing

-	Propre collection of the sample

__Post analytical errors:__

-	Transcription errors in reporting

-	Report sent to the wrong location

-	Report illegible

-	Report not sent

__Reference Range:__

5- 20 mg/dl
