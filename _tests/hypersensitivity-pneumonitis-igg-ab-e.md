__Sample type:__

Serum (Red-top tube or gel-barrier tube)

__Uses:__

The test is used to detect the presence of precipitating antibodies associated with hypersensitivity pneumonitis.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is an interstitial lung disease that is characterized by a complex immunological reaction of the lung parenchyma in response to repetitive inhalation and subsequent sensitization to a wide variety of inhaled organic dusts. HP is associated with progressive pulmonary disability, irreversible lung damage, and mortality in some cases. HP can be classified as Acute/Inflammatory (symptoms less than six months) and Chronic/Fibrotic (symptoms more than six months) based on clinical, radiologic and pathologic characteristics.  The name previously used for this condition, extrinsic allergic alveolitis, has been largely abandoned because inflammation involves more than just the alveoli and can extend to the bronchioles as well. The severity of the disease and clinical presentation varies depending on the quantity and type of inhaled antigen causing the condition. Numerous antigens have been found to cause HP.

__Precaution:__

Methodology: Fluorescence Enzyme Immunoassay (FEIA)

Causes for Rejection is excessive hemolysis


__Interfering factors:__

1)	IgG antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus, Thermoactinomyces vulgaris or Micropolyspora faeni are detectable in sera from healthy individuals and the presence of antibodies is not sufficient to establish the diagnosis of Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis. 

2)	Elevated concentration of antibodies to Aspergillus faeni are found in patient with invasive aspergillosis and cavitary lung disease as well as Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis. 

3)	The levels of antibodies to these antigens often decrease following treatment; but elevated levels may persist in treated patients for long periods. The measurement of IgG antibodies to these antigens should not be relied upon exclusively to establish the diagnosis of Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis.

__Pre analytical error:__ 

1)	Specimens other than serum; improper labeling; samples not stored properly; samples older than stability limits.

2)	 Take sample type different from that recommended in this test and analysis it in laboratory.

3)	Not to put the name of the patient or error when putting the code of patient on the tube when sampling.

4)	 sample is contaminated from technicians, this sample will be cultured in microbiology LAB.

__Corrective action:__ 

1)	refused the sample and ordered another sample.

2)	The sample should be rejected and order another sample. 

3)	anther sample request and should attention at next time.

4)	The sample must be rejected, and another sample will be requested.


__Post analytical error:__

1)	Sharing the results of patients or writing the result incorrectly.

2)	write a wrong Patient name   in patient report.

__Corrective action:__

1)	communicate with patient then delivered him the correct results   and   we apologize for this mistake.

2)	the report is not delivered to the patient and the error must be discovered.
