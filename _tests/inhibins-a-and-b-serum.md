__Sample type__

 Inhibins A : Serum, frozen (Red-top tube or gel-barrier tube)

Inhibins B : Serum(Red-top tube or gel-barrier tube)

__Uses__

To help determine whether you have an ovarian tumor, often along with a test for CA-125; to help diagnose rare ovarian granulosa cell tumors and sometimes mucinous epithelial ovarian tumors, to evaluate the effectiveness of their treatment and to monitor whether the tumor has returned after treatment

__Precautions__

This test may exhibit interference when sample is collected from a person who is consuming a supplement with a high dose of biotin (also termed as vitamin B7 or B8, vitamin H, or coenzyme R). It is recommended to ask all patients who may be indicated for this test about biotin supplementation. Patients should be cautioned to stop biotin consumption at least 72 hours prior to the collection of a sample.

__Interfering factors__

Inhibin values fluctuate during the menstrual cycle. Inhibin levels in premenopausal women should be interpreted with caution.  

The same method should be used to serially monitor patients. Some patients who have been exposed to animal antigens, either in the environment or as part of treatment or imaging procedures, may have circulating anti-animal antibodies present. These antibodies may interfere with the assay reagents to produce unreliable results.

__Pre-analytical errors__

1- If the sample was drawn on the wrong tube, or if there was cross hemolysis or cross lipemia

2-If the patient takes a supplement with a high dose of biotin, it will have an effect on the result.

__The corrective action__

1-The sample must be rejected and another sample be obtained.

2-Tell the patient to stop taking the supplement with a high dose of biotin at least 72 hours prior to the collection of a sample.

__Post-analytical errors__ 

 1-reports were sent to the incorrect patient

2-write the wrong name in the report or the wrong results.

__The corrective action__

1-communication with patient, apologising for the error, and providing him with the correct report

2-If the report is not delivered to the patient and this error is discovered, the correct result or the correct name must be written, but if the report is delivered to the patient, you must communicate with him, apologise to him, and tell him that an error has occurred and replace it with the correct report.
