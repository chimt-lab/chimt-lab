__Sample type:__ 

Serum or urine 

__Test use:__ 

Immunoassay for the in vitro quantitative determination of the sum of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) plus the hCG beta-subunit in human serum and plasma.1This assay is intended for the early detection of pregnancy. 

__Precautions:__ 

It’s also important to use the test when your urine isn’t diluted excessively with water. Use the test when your urine is very concentrated, like when you first wake up in the morning. 

__Interfering factors:__ 

1)	Lipemia, hemolysis, and radioisotopes administered within 1 week of testing may affect results. 

2)	Test results can be positive up to 1 week after complete abortion.  False - negative and false - positive results can be caused by many drugs.

__Pre analytical errors:__ 

Citrate plasma specimen; improper labelling. 

__Post analytical errors:__ 

1)	Delayed reported. 

2)	Incorrect calculation. 

__Corrective actions:__ 

Measurement of the HCG concentration permits the diagnosis of pregnancy just one week after conception. The determination of HCG in the first trimester of pregnancy is of particular importance. Elevated values here serve as an indication of chorionic carcinoma, hydatiform mole, or multiple pregnancy. Depressed values indicate threatening or missed abortion, ectopic pregnancy, gestosis or intrauterine death. 

Elevated HCG concentrations not associated with pregnancy are found in patients with other diseases, such as tumors of the germ cells, ovaries, bladder, pancreas, stomach, lungs, and liver.
