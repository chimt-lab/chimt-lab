__Sample type__

Serum (Red-top tube or gel-barrier tube)

__Uses__

GH tests are used to diagnose GH disorders, including:

-	GH deficiency. In children, GH is essential for normal growth and development. A GH deficiency can cause a child to grow more slowly and be much shorter than children of the same age. In adults, GH deficiency can lead to low bone density and reduced muscle mass.

-	Gigantism. This is a rare childhood disorder that causes the body to produce too much GH. Children with gigantism are very tall for their age and have large hands and feet.

-	Acromegaly. This disorder, which affects adults, causes the body to produce too much growth hormone. Adults with acromegaly have thicker than normal bones and enlarged hands, feet, and facial features.

__Precautions__

-	Your healthcare provider may ask you to stop taking oral estrogens for a time before this test. You also may be told to not eat or drink anything but water for a certain amount of time before the test.

-	Be sure your healthcare provider knows about all medicines, herbs, vitamins, and supplements you are taking. This includes medicines that don't need a prescription and any illegal drugs you may use.
