__Sample type__ 

Blood sample (EDTA Blood) 

__Uses__ 

measures the average size of your red blood cells , If your red blood cells are too small or too large, it could be a sign of a blood disorder such as anemia, a vitamin deficiency. 

__Precautions__ 

Diet, activity level, medicines, a women's menstrual cycle, and other considerations can affect the results 

__Interfering factors__ 

Patients with vitamin B12 deficiency and presentation of nausea, increased flatulence, diarrhea, weight loss, and anorexia can increase MCV. 

__Pre analytical errors__

1. Cold agglutination sample reduces the number of blood cells as a number, but as a volume, it increases in size and causes an increase in MCV.

2. Samples stored at room temperature for several hours may give falsely high readings 
for MCV, because red blood cells swell as they absorb water from the plasma.


__Corrective action__ 

Appropriate temperature and other preservation factors are important. 

__Post analytical errors__ 

Wrong calculation of MCV 

__Corrective action__ 

Use the corrective calculation formula to calculate MCV result ( MCV = hematocrit (percent) x 10 / red blood cell count (millions/mm3 blood) .


__Normal range__ 

- Adult/elderly/child: 80-95 fL 

- Newborn: 96-108 fL
