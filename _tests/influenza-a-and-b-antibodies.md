s: i
---


__Sample type:__

Red-top tube or gel-barrier tube

Serum

__Uses:__

Detect antibodies to influenza A and B

__Precautions:__

Collect specimens as early in the illness as possible (ideally less than 4 days from illness onset).

Follow manufacturerâ€™s instructions, including acceptable specimens, and handling.

Follow-up negative results with confirmatory tests (RT-PCR or viral culture) if a laboratory-confirmed influenza diagnosis is desired.

__Interfering Factors:__

1)	Clinical signs and symptoms consistent with influenza

Having clinical signs and symptoms consistent with influenza increases the pre-test probability of influenza virus infection, which increases the reliability of a positive influenza A and B antibodies result.

2)	Influenza activity varies seasonally, which directly affects the predictive values of influenza A and B Ab test. 

3)	Time from illness onset to collection of respiratory specimens for testing

4)	Testing specimens collected within 3-4 days of illness onset (when influenza viral shedding is highest) is more likely to yield positive influenza A and B (ab) results if the patient has influenza.
