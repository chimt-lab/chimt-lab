__Sample type:__ 

Serum. 

__Test use:__ 

Detect possible allergic responses to various substances in the environment (see Test Includes) and evaluate for hay fever, asthma, atopic eczema, and respiratory allergy. The quantitative allergen-specific IgE test is indicated to determine whether an individual has elevated allergen-specific IgE antibodies; if specific allergic sensitivity is needed to allow immunotherapy to be initiated; when testing individuals for agents that may potentially cause anaphylaxis 

__Precautions:__ 

__Interfering factors:__ 

False Positive" Results the test may be measuring your response to the undigested food proteins. It is possible that after digestion, the food protein that enters your bloodstream is no longer detected by your IGE. The test may be detecting proteins that are similar among foods but do not trigger allergic reactions. 

Negative result means you probably do not have a true allergy. That means your immune system probably does not respond to the allergen tested. However, it is possible to have a normal (negative) allergy blood test result and still have an allergy. 

__Pre analytical errors:__ 

Improper labelling; gross hemolysis. 

__Post analytical errors:__ 

1)	Delayed reported. 

2)	Incorrect calculation. 

__Corrective actions:__ 

Rejecting any sample with anticoagulant.
