s: m
---


__Sample type__

Blood sample (EDTA Blood).

__Uses__ 

1.	It is done as part of blood indices.

2.	It is done to diagnose anemia (This is the mean of the weight of average hemoglobin in one RBC) .                   

__Precautions__ 

1.Person should be on their usual diet.

2.Keep in mind that the abnormal size of the RBC may affect the value.

3.The presence of cold agglutinins gives false raised value.

4 . Raised WBC count also affects the value.


__Interfering factors__ 

Diet and medicines can affect the results of MCH  :-  iron rich food can increase the result of MCH .

__Pre analytical errors__ 

Hemolysis can affect the result of hemoglobin and also affect the result of MCH .

__Post analytical errors__ 

Wrong calculation of MCH 

__Corrective action__ 

 MCH = Hb (in g/L)/RBC (in millions/µL) or. MCH = [Hb (in g/dL)/RBC (in millions/µL)] x 10.

__Normal range__

The normal range for MCH is between 27.5 and 33.2 picograms (pg).
