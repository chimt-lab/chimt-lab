__Sample type:__

Serum Separator Tube (SST) or RedTube. 

CSF

__Uses:__

1)	To search for antibodies against neuronal cell surface proteins.

2)	Autoantibodies against GABA-A receptor (Gamma-amino butyric acid type A receptor) have been reported in patients with autoimmune encephalitis. Typical clinical features include encephalitis with seizures (including status epilepticus), confusion, disorientation, hallucinations, cognitive dysfunction. Lower titers have also been associated with Stiff person syndrome.

__Precaution:__

Gamma-amino butyric acid receptor, type B (GABA-BR) antibody is found in a subset of patients with autoimmune limbic encephalitis and may occur with or without associated tumor. Decreasing antibody levels may be associated with therapeutic response; therefore, clinical correlation must be strongly considered. A negative test result does not rule out a diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis. 
 
__Interfering factors:__ 

If the patient is taking immunosuppressive drugs as a treatment, this leads to a problem in the result of the analysis.

__Pre analytical error:__

1)	Non-frozen sample received; non-separated sample received.

2)	Not to put the name of the patient or error when putting the code of patient on the tube when sampling. 

__Corrective action:__

1)	The sample must be rejected and anther sample request. 

2)	anther sample request and should attention at next time 

__Post analytical error:__

Sharing the results of patients or writing the result incorrectly.

__Corrective action:__ 

 Quickly inform the patient that the result in the report is wrong, apologize to the patient for this behavior and should receive the correct result.
