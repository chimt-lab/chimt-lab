__Sample type:__  

-	Green-top (sodium heparin) tube or lavender-top (EDTA) tube.

__Uses:__

-	Determination of TPMT levels that may be associated with toxicity of anticancer and anti-inflammatory drugs.

__Precautions:__

-	For measuring TPMT enzyme activity (TPMT phenotyping), the test must be performed prior to taking a thiopurine drug since it may affect results

__Interfering Factors:__

-	For patients having an intrinsic low level of TPMT, recent RBC transfusion can variably increase their assayed enzymatic activity depending on the amount and circulating half-life of the transfused red blood cells.

__Pre analytical errors:__

1.	Inappropriate specimen received.

2.	Unlabeled specimen or name discrepancy between specimen and request label;

3.	Specimen received after prolonged delay (usually more than 72 hours); 

4.	Specimen received in expired transport container.

__Corrective action:__

1.	Appropriate specimen received.

2.	Labeled specimen and no name discrepancy between specimen and request label.

3.	Specimen received without delay.

4.	Specimen received in valid transport container.

__Post analytical errors:__

1.	Failure in reporting. 

2.	Erroneous validation of analytical data.

3.	Improper data entry.

__Corrective action:__

1.	Write correct report.

2.	All analytical data should be valid.

3.	Proper data entry.

__Reference range:__

-	Normal: 15.1−26.4 units/mL RBC.

-	Heterozygous for low TPMT variant: 6.3−15.0 units/mL RBC.

-	Homozygous for low TPMT variant: <6.3 units/mL RBC.
