__Sample type__ 

Blood sample (EDTA Blood)

__Uses__

MCHC checks the average amount of hemoglobin in a group of red blood cells :- 

- This is part of CBC (Complete blood count). 

- This helps to diagnose the type of anemia. 

- Mostly advised to diagnose macrocytic anemia.



__Precautions__

- It is done on blood in EDTA (anticoagulant). 

- Whole blood stable 6 hours at 25 °C and 24 hours at 4 °C. 

- Fetal blood collected by percutaneous umbilical blood.


__Interfering factors__

1. Treatments for conditions causing high MCHC can include corticosteroids, splenectomy, and blood transfusions.  

2. The abnormal size of the RBCs may affect the MCHC. 

3. Increased level of lipids in the blood gives a high result because of high hemoglobin


__Pre analytical errors__ 

It can also occur in conditions where red blood cells are fragile or destroyed, leading to hemoglobin being present outside of the red blood cells. 

__Corrective action__

Appropriate temperature and other preservation conditions are important. 

__Post analytical errors__ 

incorrect results reported because of post-analytical data entry errors and transcription errors and wrong calculation. 

__Normal range__ 

in adults is 33.4–35.5 grams per deciliter (g/dL).
