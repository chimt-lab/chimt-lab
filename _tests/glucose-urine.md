__Sample type__

1.	Random Urine

2.	24-h Urine

 __Uses__

1.	Aiding the evaluation of glucosuria and renal tubular defects 

2.	Management of DM (diabetes mellitus)

__Precautions__ 

Your health care provider will need to collect a sample of your urine. During your office visit, you will receive a container in which to collect the urine and special 

instructions to ensure the sample is sterile. These instructions are often referred to as the "clean catch method." The clean catch method includes the following steps:

1.	Wash your hands.

2.	Clean your genital area with a cleansing pad. Men should wipe the tip of their penis. Women should open their labia and clean from front to back.

3.	Start to urinate into the toilet.

4.	Move the collection container under your urine stream.

5.	Collect at least an ounce or two of urine into the container, which should have markings to indicate the amount.

6.	Finish urinating into the toilet.

7.	Return the sample container as instructed by your health care provider.

__Interfering factors__

1.	Prolonged exposure of urine sample to room temperature lower glucose results due to microbial contamination and glycolysis. 

2.	Specific gravity >1.020 and increased pH cause reduced sensitivity and falsely low glucose levels

__Pre-analytical errors__

Long-term exposure of urine samples to room temperature reduces glucose results.

__The corrective action__

If you can't do a test on a urine sample within 1 hour, you should put the container in the fridge at around 4C.

__Post-analytical errors__

1. reports were sent to the incorrect patient

2. write the wrong name in the report or the wrong results.

__The corrective action__

1. communication with patient, apologising for the error, and providing him with the correct report

2. If the report is not delivered to the patient and this error is discovered, the correct result or the correct name must be written, but if the report is delivered to the patient, you must communicate with him, apologise to him, and tell him that an error has occurred and replace it with the correct report.

__Reference Range__

Urine Random 5.0 - 15 mg/dL (0.28 - 0.83 mmol/L)
