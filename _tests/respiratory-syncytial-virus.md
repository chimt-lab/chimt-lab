To study the antigenic characteristics of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), we developed and evaluated monoclonal antibodies to three strains of RSV

respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) during acute infection in adults is difficult because of the poor sensitivity of viral culture and antigen detection. A recently developed single-tube nested reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was compared to viral culture and serology by enzyme immunoassay for the diagnosis of RSV in adults with respiratory illness.
 
__Sample type:__

Nasopharyngeal samples were obtained by gently rubbing the deep nasal turbinates bilaterally with sterile cotton swabs and combining them with a third swab from the posterior pharynx in 3 ml of veal infusion broth.

__Uses:__

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can be detected by rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs), direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, and culture. If RSV is the main concern, DFA testing or RADTs may be used, particularly in infants and children

__Precaution:__

-	Nasal aspirate.  doctor uses a suction device to take out a sample of your nasal secretions to test for the presence of the virus.

-	Nasal wash.  doctor fills a sterile, squeezable bulb-shaped tool with a saline solution, inserts the tip of the bulb into your nostril, slowly squeezes the solution into your nose, then stops squeezing to suck a sample of your secretions into the bulb for testing.

Nasopharyngeal (NP) swab.  doctor slowly inserts a small swab into your nostril until it reaches the back of your nose. They’ll move it around gently to gather a sample of your nasal secretions, then slowly remove it from your nostril.

__Interfering factors:__

To study viral interference, we evaluated cases of RSV and HRV codetection by polymerase chain reaction in 2 prospective birth cohort studies (the Infant Susceptibility to Pulmonary Infections and Asthma Following RSV Exposure [INSPIRE] study and the Tennessee Children’s Respiratory Initiative [TCRI]) and a double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial (MAKI), using adjusted multivariable regression analyses.

  __Pre analytical errors:__

1.	arise during patient preparation,

2.	sample collection,

3.	sample transportation,

4.	sample preparation

__corrective action:__

after taking the sample by nosal swab, it is prepared and sent to a specific container immediately for examination.

__Post analytical errors:__

post analytical errors ranging from improper entry of data to errors in strategies used for the interpretation of laboratory data are also highlighted.
