__Sample type__

Serum or plasma (lithium heparin)

__Uses__

Monitoring of blood phosphate level in renal, endocrine, and GI disorders

__Precautions__ 

Separate serum or plasma from cells within 45 minutes of collection.

Do not use oxalate, EDTA, or citrate plasma.

Maintain specimen at room temperature.

__Interfering factors__

Should be measured in fasting morning specimens because of a diurnal variation. Phosphorus has a very strong biphasic circadian rhythm. 

Values are lowest in the morning, peak first in the late afternoon, and peak again in the late evening. 

The second peak is quite elevated and results may be outside the reference range. Levels are influenced by dietary intake, meals, and exercise. 

__Pre-analytical errors__

1.	Samples unspun or improperly spun

__The corrective action__

The sample must be rejected and another sample be obtained.

2.	Hemolysis or Lipemia or Icterus sample

__The corrective action__

 The sample must be rejected and another sample be obtained


__Post-analytical errors__

I.	reports were sent to the incorrect patient

__The corrective action__

communication with patient, apologizing for the error, and providing him with the correct report

II.	If the patient's gender is written wrong in the report, the reference range was written incorrectly

__The corrective action__

If the report is not delivered to the patient and this error is discovered, fix it, but if the report is delivered to the patient, apologise to him, tell him that an error has occurred, and replace it with the correct report. And next time, Be careful when you write down the gender and reference range.

__Reference range__

|     Age                    |     Reference Range     |     Critical Range        |
|----------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
|     0-28 days              |     4.2 to 9.0 mg/dL    |     >1.2 mg/dL            |
|     28 days to 2 years     |     3.8 to 6.2 mg/dL    |     <1.2 or >8.9 mg/dL    |
|     2-16 years             |     3.5 to 5.9 mg/dL    |     <1.2 or >8.9mg/dL     |
|     >16 years              |     2.5 to 4.5 mg/d     |     <1.2 or >8.9mg/dL     |
