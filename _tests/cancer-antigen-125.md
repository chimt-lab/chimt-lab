__Uses:__

CA 125 II assay is indicated for use as an aid in the detection of residual or recurrent ovarian carcinoma in patients who have undergone first-line therapy and would be considered for second-look procedures.

The Elecsys CA 125 II assay is further indicated for serial measurement of CA 125 to aid in the management of cancer patients.

__Precautions:__

It is suggested that the assay not be performed until at least three weeks after the completion of primary chemotherapy and at least two months following abdominal surgery.

__Interfering Factors:__

1)	This test may exhibit interference when sample is collected from a person who is consuming a supplement with a high dose of biotin

2)	Erroneous findings may be obtained from samples taken from patients who have been treated with monoclonal mouse antibodies or have received them for diagnostic purposes.

3)	Interference due to extremely high titers of antibody to streptavidin and ruthenium can occur.

__Pre analytical errors:__

1)	Use of citrate plasma specimen.

2)	Taking biotin before the test.

__Corrective action:__

Reject any citrate plasma specimen; improper labeling.

The results should always be assessed in conjunction with the patient's medical history, clinical examination, and other findings.

__Post analytical errors:__

1)	Writing wrong result in the report.

2)	Send the report to incorrect patient.

3)	Making wrong calculation.

__Corrective action:__

1)	Writing correct result in the report.

2)	Send the report to correct patient.

3)	Making good calculation.

__Reference range:__

The reference range of CA 125 is 0-35 units/mL (0-35 kU/L).
