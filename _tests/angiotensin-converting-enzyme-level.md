__Sample type:__

Blood sample from vein (Serum)

__Uses:__

High in sarcoidosis, more often when the disease is active. Of value in assessing the response of sarcoidosis to corticosteroid therapy. Changes in serum ACE correlate with clinical status and results of gallium scans (which reflect presence and activity of inflammatory granulomatous lesions). Falling ACE level is a favorable prognostic sign. Rising levels may reflect activity uncontrolled by therapy.

__Precautions:__

-	Follow your health care provider's instructions for not eating or drinking for up to 12 hours before the test.

-	Stop administration of captopril, enalapril, or lisinopril for 12 hours prior to venipuncture (reduces ACE activity).

-	Specimen Type Serum  Refrigerated (preferred) 7 days Frozen180 days Ambient24 hours.

__Interference factor:__

-	If you are on steroid medicine, ask your provider if you need to stop the medicine before the test, because steroids can decrease ACE levels. DO NOT stop any medicine before talking to your provider.

-	Granulomas, fibrosis and elevated ACE levels may also be seen with infectious disorders, such as leprosy and tuberculosis .

Gross hemolysis ,lipemia, icterus,Specimen not serum.

__The corrective action:__
