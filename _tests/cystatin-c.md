n: Cystatin C
a: CysC
s: c
---


__Sample type__

 Serum or plasma

Red-top tube, gel-barrier tube, or green-top (heparin) tube 

 __Uses__

Since it is formed at a constant rate and freely filtered by the healthy kidney, cystatin C is a good marker of renal function. Serum concentrations of cystatin C are almost totally dependent on glomerular filtration rate (GFR).A reduction in GFR causes a rise in the concentration of cystatin C.

 __Precautions__

Cystatin C has not been shown to be affected by factors such as muscle mass and nutrition, factors which have been demonstrated to affect creatinine values. In addition, a rise in creatinine does not become evident until the GFR has fallen by approximately 50%.

__Interfering factors__ 

Specimen other than serum or heparinized plasma; grossly hemolyzed (>1,000 mg/dL Hgb) samples; excessive turbidity and clots in samples

__Pre_analytical errors__

. Forget frozen sample

__The corrective action__ 

Frozen sample 

 __Post-analytical errors__

Write another patient's name in the report

__The corrective action__ 

Make sure you write the correct name in the report
