__Sample type:__

-	Samples may be taken from: blood, urine ,sputum (spit) ,inside the cervix and pus-containing wound

__Uses:__

-	A culture is a test to find germs (such as bacteria or a fungus) that can cause an infection.

-	A sensitivity test checks to see what kind of medicine, such as an antibiotic, will work best to treat the illness or infection.

-	For a culture, a sample of body fluid or tissue is added to a substance that promotes the growth of germs. If no germs grow, the culture is negative. If germs that can cause infection grow, the culture is positive. The type of germ may be identified using a microscope or chemical tests. Bacteria usually grow quickly in a culture (2 days), while other types of organisms, such as a fungus, can take longer.

-	A culture and sensitivity test may be done on many different body fluids, such as urine, mucus, blood, pus, saliva, breast milk, spinal fluid, or discharge from the vagina or penis.

__Precaution:__ 

-	A sterile swab may be used to collect cells or pus from a superficial wound site. From deeper wounds, aspirations of fluid into a syringe and/or a tissue biopsy are the optimal specimens to allow for the recovery of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.

-	The test is done by taking a sample from the infected site. The most common types of tests are listed below.

1)	Blood culture: A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial.

2)	Urine culture: You will provide a sterile sample of urine in a cup, as instructed by your health care provider.

3)	Wound culture: Your health care provider will use a special swab to collect a sample from the site of your wound.

4)	Sputum culture: You may be asked to cough up sputum into a special cup, or a special swab may be used to take a sample from your nose.

5)	Throat culture: Your health care provider will insert a special swab into your mouth to take a sample from the back of the throat and tonsils.

__Interfering factors:__

-	Antibiotics shouldnâ€™t be expired Because this gives results give false result.

-	The recommendations made in UK SMIs are based on evidence (for example sensitivity and specificity) where available, expert opinion and pragmatism, with consideration also being given to available resources. Laboratories should take account of local requirements and undertake additional investigations where appropriate. Prior to use, laboratories should ensure that all commercial and in-house tests have been validated and are fit for purpose.


__Pre analytical error:__ 

1)	Specimens other than serum; improper labeling; samples not stored properly; samples older than stability limits; gross hemolysis; gross lipemia.

2)	 Take sample type different from that recommended in this test and analysis it in laboratory.

3)	Not to put the name of the patient or error when putting the code of patient on the tube when sampling.

4)	 sample is contaminated from technicians, this sample will be cultured in microbiology LAB.

__Corrective action:__ 

1)	refused the sample and ordered another sample.

2)	The sample should be rejected and order another sample. 

3)	anther sample request and should attention at next time.

4)	The sample must be rejected, and another sample will be requested.


__Post analytical error:__

1)	Sharing the results of patients or writing the result incorrectly.

2)	write a wrong Patient name   in patient report.

Corrective action:

1)	communicate with patient then delivered him the correct results   and   we apologize for this mistake.

2)	the report is not delivered to the patient and the error must be discovered.

__Reference Range:__ 	 

-	Positive :>100,000 colonies/ml	    

-	Indeterminate: 10,000-100,000 colonies/ml	

-	Negative: <10,000 colonies/ml
