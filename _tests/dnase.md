__Uses of:__

It is used to differentiate S.aureus (DNase +ve) from other Staphylococci that do not produce such enzyme. The DNase test is particularly useful when plasma is not available to perform a coagulase test or when the results of a coagulase test are difficult to interpret.

DNase test distinguishes M. catarrhalis from all other gram-negative diplococci (e.g. Neisseria gonorrhoeae & Neisseria meningitidis) of human origin.

__Sample type:__

Colonies on agar plate .

__Precautions:__

sterile the loop before use .

Reject unlabeled specimen 

__Interfering factors:__

Some MRSA strains do not give positive DNase test result and some strains of the coagulase-negative staphylococci such as Staphylococcus capitis may give weak reactions.

Serratia and Moraxella species also produce deoxyribonuclease.

1N HCl is bactericidal for Staphylococci. Once the HCl has been applied, the test must be read within 5 minutes and cannot be continued by re-incubation

__Pre analytical errors:__ 

Non sterilized loop 

Sample preparation 

__Post errors:__ 

Delayed report

__Corrective action:__

Sterile the loop to avoid contamination
