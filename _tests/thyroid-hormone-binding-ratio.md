__Sample type :-__

Serum

__Uses :-__

-	measures the "uptake" of T3 or T4 tracer by Thyroid Binding Globulin (TBG) in a given serum sample. This provides an indirect and reciprocal estimate of the available binding sites on TBG within the sample.


__Precautions :-__

-	no special preparations before the test.

__Interfering factors :-__

-	It is directly proportional to the fraction of FT4 , and inversely proportional to the TBG binding sites.

-	Pregnancy ,estrogen and birth control pills alter the concentration of  the thyroxine-binding protein

-	Invalid if other proteins or immunoglobulins compete with TBG, including Familial Dysalbuminemic Hypertuhyroxinemia.

-	Concordance values of T4 and THBR tests suggest altered thyroid function.

-	 Discordant variance suggests primary change in TBG in a euthyroid state (e.g., pregnancy)

__Pre-analytical errors :-__

1-	Unlabeled or mislabeled specimen

2-	Hemolysis or lipemic samples

__The corrective action__ 

Reject the sample and another one will be requested.

__Post-analytical errors:-__

1-	write wrong name on the report or wrong results and send the report to the patient. 

2-	Send the report to the wrong patient.

__The Corrective action__ 

  1 - make sure that all data of the patient are correct.

   2 - you must communicate with the patient and apologize for this mistake and sent the right report.

__Reference range :-__ 

 5.93–13.13 μg/dL.
