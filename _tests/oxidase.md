__Sample type__

colonies on an agar plate

__Uses .__

The oxidase test is used to determine if an organism possesses the cytochrome oxidase enzyme.

The test is used as an aid for the differentiation of Neisseria, Moraxella, Campylobacter and Pasteurella species (oxidase positive).

It is also used to differentiate pseudomonads from related species

__Interfering factors.__ 

Use of a nichrome or other iron containing loop may yield false-positive reactions. Platinum loops are recommended.

Most Haemophilus  are oxidase-positive. Less sensitive strips or reagents may yield false-negative result.

Oxidase reactions of gram-negative bacilli should be determined on non-selective and non-differential media to ensure valid results. Also, colonies taken from media containing high levels of glucose may give false-negative reactions

__Precautions:__

Do not use wire loop to transfer the culture as oxidase reagent may reacts with iron or nichrome to give false result

Observe the result within 10 seconds as Atmospheric Oxygen may react with reagent to give false positive result.

Culture should not be more than 24 hours old.

__Pre analytical errors__ 

Sample preparation 

Unlabeled sample

Use of wire loop to transfere the culture.

__Post errors__ 

Incorrect results 

Delayed report

__Corrective action__ 

Don't use wire loop to transfere culture
