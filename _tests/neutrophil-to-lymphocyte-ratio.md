__Sample type:__

-	Lavender-top (EDTA) tube.

__Uses:__

-	NLR (Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio) is a biomarker that can be used as an indication of subclinical inflammation.

-	NLR is a calculation based on the Absolute Neutrophil Count divided by the Absolute Lymphocyte Count determined by the peripheral blood CBC differential.

-	This calculation, according to recent literature, is useful in assessing the likelihood of severe progression of disease in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients.

__Precautions:__

-	Maintain specimen at room temperature.

-	Avoid infecton of patient before taking the sample.

-	Donâ€™t take oral heparin before the test.

__Interfering Factors:__

-	High NLR in patients with septic shock and bacteremia.

-	High in cardio chock.

-	High in massive pulmonary embolism.

__Pre analytical errors:__

1.	Inappropriate specimen received.

2.	Unlabeled specimen or name discrepancy between specimen and request label;

3.	Specimen received after prolonged delay (usually more than 72 hours); 

4.	Specimen received in expired transport container.

__Corrective action:__

1.	Appropriate specimen received.

2.	Labeled specimen and no name discrepancy between specimen and request label.

3.	Specimen received without delay.

4.	Specimen received in valid transport container.

__Post analytical errors:__

1.	Failure in reporting. 

2.	Erroneous validation of analytical data.

3.	Improper data entry.

__Corrective action:__

1.	Write correct report.

2.	All analytical data should be valid.

3.	Proper data entry.

__Reference range:__

-	A normal NLR is roughly 1-3.

-	An NLR of 6-9 suggests mild stress (e.g. a patient with uncomplicated appendicitis).

-	Critically ill patients will often have an NLR of ~9 or higher (occasionally reaching values close to 100).
