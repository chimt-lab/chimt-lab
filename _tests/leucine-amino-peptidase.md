__Sample type__

24-hour urine

__Uses__

1-As a marker of hepatic and pancreatic carcinoma.

2-As a marker of early tubular (renal) injury in diabetes and as an indicator of SLE activity.

3-Parallels serum ALP except that

-	LAP is usually normal in the presence of bone disease or malabsorption syndrome.

-	LAP is a more sensitive indicator of choledocholithiasis and of liver metastases in anicteric patients.

4-When serum LAP is increased, urine LAP is almost always increased, but when urine LAP is increased, serum LAP may have already returned to normal.

__Precautions__

make sure that a 24-hour urine sample has been collected

24-hour urine sample collection instructions

- On day 1, urinate into the toilet when you get up in the morning.

- Afterward, collect all urine in a special container for the next 24 hours.

- On day 2, urinate into the container when you get up in the morning.

- Cap the container. Keep it in the refrigerator or a cool place during the collection period.

- Label the container with your name, the date, the time of completion, and return it

__Interferring factor__ 

1-Testing serum LAP is generally not as sensitive or as convenient as testing other liver enzymes to detect some liver problems. ALT, AST, ALP, LDH, and GGT are more commonly measured for the same purpose. Unlike other liver enzymes, LAP can be measured in the urine.

__Pre analytical errors__

If the sample was not collected with the correct instructions ,it will affect the result

__The corrective action__

The patient must be given the instructions that the sample must be 
collected, and before taking the sample make sure that he follows these 
instructions

__Post-analytical errors__ 

1- Write another patient's name on the report

__The corrective action__

Make sure you write the correct name on the report

2-Writing a wrong result in the report

__The corrective action__

If the report is not delivered to the patient and this error is discovered
the correct result must be written, but if the report is delivered to the
patient, must communicate with him and tell him that an error has occurred 
and replace the report with the report in which there is the correct result .

__Reference range__

1.0â€“3.3 U/mL
