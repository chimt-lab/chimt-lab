The factor V (five) assay is a blood test to measure the activity of factor V.

This is one of the proteins in the body that helps the blood clot.

__Sample type:__

Whole blood Light Blue top (Buffered Na Citrate)

__Uses:__

This test is used to find the cause of too much bleeding (decreased blood clotting). This decreased clotting may be caused by an abnormally low level of factor V.

__Precautions:__

-	Patient should not be receiving heparin. If so, this should be noted on the request form. Heparin therapy can affect certain coagulation factors or assays, preclude their performance, or cause spurious results. Indicate when specimen is drawn from a line or a heparin lock. Deliver immediately to the laboratory.

-	Patients with hematocrit levels of >55% must have a special tube made to adjust for the hematocrit. Contact the laboratory for special tube. Mix thoroughly by gentle inversion.

-	Avoid Coumadin therapy for two weeks and heparin therapy for two days prior to the test.

__Interfering factors:__

-	Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which is a condition that causes small blood clots and

-	excessive bleeding due to overactive clotting proteins

-	Liver diseases, such as cirrhosis

-	Secondary fibrinolysis, which occurs when clots tend to break down due to medications or health conditions

-	Autoimmune diseases, such as lupus

-	Spontaneous autoimmune reactions after surgery or childbirth

-	Certain types of cancer

__Pre analytical errors:__

1. Missing sample and/or test request

2. Wrong/missing identification

3. In vitro hemolysis

4. Undue clotting

5. Wrong container

6. Contamination from infusion route

7. Insufficient sample

8. Inappropriate blood to anticoagulant ratio

9. Insufficient mixing of the sample

10. Inappropriate transport and storage conditions

11. Inappropriate centrifugation conditions

__Corrective action:__

-	Continuous training and performance evaluation of paramedical staff &Residents

-	Coordination & communication between clinical & laboratory personnel

-	Checkpoint monitoring at the sample reception desk & all workstations

__Post analytical errors:__

-	Result Report

-	Result interpretation

-	Result distribution

__Reference Range:__

5- 10 mg/dl
