__Sample type:__

A blood sample drawn from a vein (Serum)

__Uses:__

-	Evaluate adrenal gland function.

-	to distinguish between androgen-secreting conditions that are caused by the adrenal glands from those that originate in the ovaries or testicles, if results of DHEAS and testosterone testing are abnormal.

-	Help diagnose tumors in the outer layer (cortex) of the adrenal gland or tumors outside of the adrenal gland that secrete ACTH (ectopic) and separate these conditions from ovarian or testicular tumors and cancers.

-	Diagnose congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and monitor CAH treatment, in addition to tests for testosterone.

-	Help diagnose polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and help rule out other causes of infertility, no monthly menstrual periods (amenorrhea), and excess body and facial hair (hirsutism) in women who have abnormal results on tests for DHEAS, testosterone, and other hormones such as FSH, LH, prolactin, and estrogen.

-	Investigate and diagnose the cause of male physical characteristics (virilization) in young girls and early (precocious) puberty in young boys.

-	Help determine the cause of delayed puberty and investigate suspected ovarian or testicular failure.

__Precautions:__

_Patient Preparation_

-	Specimen should be collected between 6-10 a.m.

-	Ambient: 24 hours; Refrigerated: 1 week; Frozen: 6 months.

-	In menstruating women, there may be specific instructions as to timing of the sample collection.

__Interference:__

-	dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) supplements can result in elevations of serum androstenedione level. 

-	many drugs and hormones can result in changes in androstenedione levels. In particular, agents that induce hepatic enzymes.

-	drugs that affect lipid metabolism.

-	and other steroid hormones are likely to affect androstenedione levels, more commonly resulting in lowered levels.

-	The use of gel-barrier tubes is not recommended due to slow absorption of the steroid by the gel. Depending on the specimen volume and storage time, the decrease in androstenedione level due to absorption may be clinically significant.

__Pre-analytical errors:__ 

use a gel-barrier tube. Gross hemolysis; lipemia.

__Corrective of action:__

The sample must be rejected and another sample obtained.

__Post-analytical errors:__

reports were sent to the incorrect patient .

__Corrective of action:__

communication with patient, apologising for the error, and providing him with the correct report.
