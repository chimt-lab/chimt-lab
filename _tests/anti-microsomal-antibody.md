__Sample type:__

serum

__Uses:__

The measurement of autoantibodies against thyroid peroxidase is useful in identifying patients with autoimmune thyroid disease

__Precaution:__

-	Analysis should not be performed on haemolysed, icteric or lipaemic samples. The assay is unaffected by biotin < 40.9 nmol/L or < 10 ng/mL. 

-	No interference was observed from rheumatoid factors up to a concentration of 1350 IU/mL. 

-	Samples should not be taken from patients receiving therapy with high biotin doses (i.e. > 5 mg/day) until at least 8 hours following the last biotin administration.

__Interference:__

In vitro tests were performed on 16 commonly used pharmaceuticals; no interference with the assay was found. In addition special drugs were tested; no interference with the assay was found. In rare cases, high titres of antibodies to analyte specific antibodies, streptavidin or ruthenium can occur.

__Pre analytical error:__

__Sample collection:__ 

Venipuncture should be performed in the most atraumatic way as possible since a good sample collection technique is vital to obtain a blood sample of adequate quality for analysis.

__Sample storage:__ 

Haematology samples should be processed and examined as soon as possible, ideally within a few hours for collection. If the sample is sent to an external laboratory, refrigeration is recommended.

__Corrective action__

Supervision of the analytical process very carefully, using state of the art analysers and having in place a daily internal quality control system and an external quality programme for most measured analytes. 


__Post analytical errors:__

-	Processing of results for transcription onto report forms

-	Reduce human error through root-cause analysis, process control, and education/communication

__Reference range:__

<35 IU/mL.
