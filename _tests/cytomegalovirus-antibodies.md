__Sample type:__

-	Serum.

__Uses:__

-	To diagnose a current, past or reactivated cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection or if it is important to know if you ever had a CMV infection, such as prior to receiving an organ transplant.

__Precautions:__

-	The sample required depends on the type of testing.

-	For CMV antibody testing, a blood sample is drawn from a vein.

-	To detect the virus itself, in patients who are symptomatic, the sample may be blood, urine, sputum, amniotic fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, duodenal fluid, other body tissues, or saliva in newborns.

-	Some samples, such as amniotic fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, or body tissue (biopsy), may require a special procedure to collect.

-	Your healthcare provider may also order a test called polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to hunt for the DNA of CMV in your urine, saliva, blood, CSF, or biopsy tissue. He or she may also order a viral culture test from any of these sample types.

__Interfering Factors:__

-	Taking antibiotics or other medicine before doing the test. This will affect the result of the test.
