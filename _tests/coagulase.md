__Use:__

Differentiates Staphylococcus aureus from other Staphylococcus species.

__Sample type:__

plasma 

__Precautions__ 

Do not use citrated blood, as false-positive results can occur.

__Interfering factors:__

Methicillin resistant Staph. aureus have reduced clumping factor.

Do not shake or agitate the tube as this could break up the clot.

Some staphylococci strains produce fibrolysin after prolonged incubation at 35Â°C that can break up the clot resulting in false negative. Incubate the tube overnight at room temperature if you do not get a clot in 4 hours.

Some other rarely encountered staph species are also coagulase positive by the tube method.

__Pre analytical errors:__

Non sterilized loop 

__Post errors:__

Delayed report

__Corrective action:__
