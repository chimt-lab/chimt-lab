__Sample type:__

-	Serum.

__Uses:__

-	Monitor gastrointestinal, pancreatic, liver, and colorectal malignancies.

__Precautions:__

-	Blood should be drawn using standard venipuncture techniques and the serum should be separated from the red blood cells as soon as practical. Avoid grossly hemolytic, lipemic or turbid samples.

-	Plasma samples collected in tubes containing EDTA, heparin, or oxalate may interfere with test procedures and should be avoided.

-	Specimens should be capped and may be stored up to 48 hours at 2-8°C, prior to assaying. Specimens held for a longer time can be frozen at -20°C. Thawed samples must be mixed prior to testing.

-	The wash procedure is critical. Insufficient washing will result in poor precision and falsely elevated absorbance readings.

	
__Interfering Factors:__

-	Patients known to be genotypically negative for Lewis blood group antigens will be unable to produce the CA 19-9 antigen even in the presence of malignant tissue.

__Pre analytical errors:__

1)	Wrong Labeling of the Containers.

2)	Errors in Specimen Preparation.

3)	Inappropriate Laboratory Test Requisition.

4)	Inadequate Volume.

__Corrective action:__

1)	Make correct Labeling of the Containers.

2)	No errors in Specimen Preparation.

3)	Appropriate Laboratory Test Requisition.

4)	Adequate Volume.


__Post analytical errors:__

1)	Failure in reporting.Erroneous 

2)	Validation of analytical data.

3)	Improper data entry.


__Corrective action:__

1)	Write correct report.

2)	All analytical data should be valid

3)	Proper data entery.


__Reference range:__

The normal range of CA 19-9 is between 0 and 37 U/mL (units/milliliter).
