---

__Sample type:__ 

Plasma, frozen; and serum, room temperature. 

__Test use:__ 

Antiphospholipid antibodies are a group of immune proteins (antibodies) that the body mistakenly produces against itself in an autoimmune response to phospholipids. Tests can detect these autoantibodies that bind to phospholipids and, in a way that is not well understood, increase the risk of excessive blood clotting. 

__Precautions:__ 

Ideally, the patient should not be on anticoagulant therapy. Avoid warfarin (CoumadinÂ®) therapy for two weeks prior to the test and heparin, direct Xa, and thrombin inhibitor therapies for about three days prior to testing.

__Interfering factors:__ 

Test done for syphilis can cause a false-positive antiphospholipid antibody test result if done at the same time. That's because the substances used to test for syphilis have phospholipids in them. You may need a second test to confirm the results.


__Pre analytical errors:__ 

Severe hemolysis; improper labeling; clotted specimen; specimen diluted with IV fluids; samples thawed in transit; improper sample type; sample out of stability 

__Post analytical errors:__  

1)	Delayed report. 

2)	You may be instructed not to eat (fast) six hours before the test.

__Corrective actions:__ 

1)	If the dilute Russell viper venom time (dRVVT) screen is high, a confirmation test will be performed.  

2)	If thrombin time is greater than 30.0 seconds, thrombin neutralization will be performed. 

3)	If activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 3 or more seconds above the upper limit of the reference range, activated partial thromboplastin time 1:1 normal plasma will be performed.
