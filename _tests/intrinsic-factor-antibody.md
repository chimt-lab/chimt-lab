__Sample type:__

-	Serum.

__Uses:__

-	To help diagnose pernicious anemia, the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency.

-	Intrinsic factor is a protein produced by a type of specialized cells that line the stomach wall known as parietal cells. During digestion, stomach acids release vitamin B12 from food and bind to intrinsic factor to form a complex. 

-	The formation of this complex is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12 in the small intestine.

__Precautions:__

-	You should wait at least 48 hours after receiving a vitamin B12 injection to have a blood sample taken. Some health care providers may prefer not to draw a blood sample for the test within 2 weeks of an injection.

__Interfering Factors:__

-	Some people with autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes, Hashimoto thyroiditis, Addison disease or graves disease may have IF antibodies without having pernicious anemia.
