__Sample type:__

-	Vaginal fluid.

__Uses:__

-	BV (sialidase) activity: Enzyme activity test for use in the detection of vaginal fluid specimens for sialidase activity, an enzyme produced by bacteria associated with bacterial vaginitis including Bacteroides spp, Prevotella spp, and Mobiluncus spp, and some G vaginalis. In a recent study, Bradshaw et al demonstrated. the test to be 88% sensitive and 95% specific.

-	Vaginal yeast culture: Detect yeast in vaginal fluid.

-	Trichomonas vaginalis by NAA: Diagnosis of T vaginalis infection.

__Precautions:__

-	BV (sialidase) activity: Collecting specimens from the cervix should be avoided because it might increase the risk to OB patients, and cervical sialidase activity is usually higher than vaginal sialidase activity. 

-	Do not collect specimens from patients who have used a vaginal cream or ointment product, douched, or used spermicides, vaginal lubricants, or feminine sprays within 72 hours of testing.

__Interfering Factors:__

-	If insufficient sample is collected or collected from a patient undergoing antimicrobial therapy, the test may yield a false-negative result.

__Pre analytical errors:__

1.	Inappropriate specimen received.

2.	Unlabeled specimen or name discrepancy between specimen and request label;

3.	Specimen received after prolonged delay (usually more than 72 hours); 

4.	Specimen received in expired transport container.

__Corrective action:__

1.	Appropriate specimen received.

2.	Labeled specimen and no name discrepancy between specimen and request label.

3.	Specimen received without delay.

4.	Specimen received in valid transport container.

__Post analytical errors:__

1.	Failure in reporting. 

2.	Erroneous validation of analytical data.

3.	Improper data entry.

__Corrective action:__

1.	Write correct report.

2.	All analytical data should be valid.

3.	Proper data entrty.
