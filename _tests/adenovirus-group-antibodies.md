__-	Sample type:__

Serum.

__-	Uses:__

Serologic diagnosis of adenovirus infection. At least 12 types of adenovirus have been associated with illnesses such as noninfluenzal acute respiratory disease, pneumonia, epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, acute febrile pharyngitis, and acute hemorrhagic cystitis. Asymptomatic infections can make serologic responses difficult to interpret.

__-	Precautions:__

1) Do not interchange reagents or Microtiterplates of different production lots.

2) Do not use reagents after expiry date stated on the label. 

3) Use only clean pipette tips, dispensers, and lab ware.

4) Investigation of a sample panel with antibody activities to potentially cross-reacting parameters did not reveal evidence of false-positive results due to cross-reactions.

__-	Interfering Factors:__

1) Bacterial contamination or repeated freeze-thaw cycles of the sample may affect the absorbance values.

2) Interferences with hemolytic, lipemic or icteric samples are not observed up to a concentration of 10 mg/mL hemoglobin, 5 mg/mL triglycerides and 0.5 mg/mL bilirubin.

__-	Pre analytical errors:__

1) Using of contaminated tubes or pipette tips, dispensers.

2) Drugs as antibiotics.

__-	Corrective action:__

Diagnosis of an infectious disease should not be established on the basis of a single test result. A precise diagnosis should take into consideration clinical history, symptomatology as well as serological data. In immunocompromised patients and newborns serological data only have restricted value.

__-	Post analytical errors:__

1) Wrong in Measure the absorbance.

2) Error from calculation of Results by using wrong equations.

__-	Reference range:__

Negative: <1:8
