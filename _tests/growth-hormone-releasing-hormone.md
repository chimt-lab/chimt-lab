__Sample type__

Serum (Red-top tube or gel-barrier tube)

__Uses__

Stimulation tests form the basis for the diagnostic process in growth hormone deficiency (GHD). One of these tests uses the GH releasing hormone (GHRH). This provides the potential to differentiate patients with pituitary dysfunction from patients with hypothalamus abnormalities. However, the routine use of the GHRH test is still being debated. 

Useful in differentiating between a pituitary tumor and ectopic GHRH hypersecretion.

__Precautions__

Following is the specimen collection process for Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone Blood Test:

__Process of obtaining blood sample in adults:__

-	A band is wrapped around the arm, 3-4 inches above the collection site (superficial vein that lies within the elbow pit)

-	The site is cleaned with 70% alcohol in an outward spiral, away from the zone of needle insertion

-	The needle cap is removed and is held in line with the vein, pulling the skin tight

-	With a small and quick thrust, the vein is penetrated using the needle

-	The required amount of blood sample is collected by pulling the plunger of the syringe out slowly

-	The wrap band is removed, gauze is placed on the collection site, and the needle is removed

-	The blood is immediately transferred into the blood container, which has the appropriate preservative/clot activator/anti-coagulant

-	The syringe and the needle are disposed into the appropriate “sharp container” for safe and hygienic disposal

Patient should not be on any medications that may influence pituitary secretion.

__Interfering factors__

Certain factors interfere with the results of the Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone Blood Test. These include:

-	Stress

-	Exercise

-	Nutrition

-	Eating disorders

Certain medications that you may be currently taking may influence the outcome of the test. Hence, it is important to inform your healthcare provider of the complete list of medications (including any herbal supplements) you are currently taking. This will help the healthcare provider interpret your test results more accurately and avoid unnecessary chances of a misdiagnosis.

__Pre-analytical errors__

1. Hemolysis or Lipemia or Icterus sample

2. If a patient takes any medications that may influence pituitary secretion.

__The corrective action__

1. The sample must be rejected and another sample be obtained.

2. Tell the patient to stop taking any medications that may influence pituitary secretion prior to the collection of a sample.

__Post-analytical errors__ 

1. reports were sent to the incorrect patient

2. write the wrong name in the report or the wrong results.

__The corrective action__

1. communication with patient, apologising for the error, and providing him with the correct report

2. If the report is not delivered to the patient and this error is discovered, the correct result or the correct name must be written, but if the report is delivered to the patient, you must communicate with him, apologise to him, and tell him that an error has occurred and replace it with the correct report.
