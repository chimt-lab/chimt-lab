__Sample type__

Whole blood

(EDTA) lavender top tube

 (ACD-Solution B) yellow top tube

__Uses__

Evaluation of nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia.-

- Investigating families with PK deficiency to determine inheritance pattern and for genetic
counseling.

__Precautions__

no special patient preparation-

Do Not centrifuge.-

- Send whole blood refrigerated in original collection container. 

Do Not transfer blood to other containers. -

- Store and ship at refrigerated temperatures.

__Interfering factors__

- Patients who have recently received transfusions have normal donor cells that may mask PK-deficient erythrocytes.

- Because leukocytes also contain pyruvate kinase that is not diminished in hereditary erythrocytic pyruvate kinase deficiency, freeing the blood of white blood cells is always critical to this test.

frozen sample -

Hemolyzed sample-

__Pre-analytical errors__

1-frozen sample, mislabeled or unlabeled specimens,hemolyzed sample.

__The corrective actions__

1-The sample should be rejected and another sample requested

__Post-analytical errors__

1-Writing a wrong result or wrong name in the report

2-report were sent to incorrect patient

__The corrective actions__

1- If the report is not delivered to the patient and this error is discovered, the correct result or the correct name must be written, but if the report is delivered to the patient, you must communicate with him, apologise to him, and tell him that an error has occurred and replace it with the correct report.
