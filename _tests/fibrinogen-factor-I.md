Fibrinogen is a complex protein (polypeptide) that, with enzyme action, is converted to fibrin. The fibrin, along with platelets, forms the network for the common blood clot. Although it is of primary importance as a coagulation protein, fibrinogen is also an acute-phase protein reactant. It is increased in diseases involving tissue damage or inflammation

__Sample type:__

Platelet free plasma Na citrate (light blue top tube)

__Uses:__

-	Used for identifying congenital afibrinogenemia

-	 Dysfibrinogenemia

-	disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)

-	 fibrinolytic activity and severe liver disease.

-	 This test is sensitive to functional fibrinogen, and insensitive to non-clot table fibrinogen and fibrin derivatives.

__Precautions:__

-	Generally, you do not need to take any special measures to prepare for this test. However, it’s important to inform the doctor if you are taking any blood thinners.

-	 Doctors may advise you to stop taking certain medications before this test.

-	 may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention

-	 Must be tested within 4 hours. 

-	Do not refrigerate. 

-	 If not received in our lab within 4 hours of collection, sample must be centrifuged and platelet-poor plasma removed from cells and transferred to an aliquot tube.

-	 Freeze at -20°C and deliver to the lab on dry ice within 2 weeks.

__Interfering factors:__

-	Severe fibrinogen deficiency may prolong) PT, PTT, and TT ( 
Increased In:

-	Acute inflammatory/infectious processes

-	cancer

-	Pregnancy and use of oral contraceptives

-	Older age

-	Early) DIC (

Decreased In:

-	Congenital afibrinogenemia or hypofibrinogenemia.

-	Dysfibrinogenemia (congenital or acquired).

-	DIC and pathologic fibrinolysis. Fibrinogen is consumed after initial elevation as an acute-phase reactant.

-	Very advanced liver disease.

__Pre analytical errors:__

-	Clotted specimens or those obtained with the wrong anticoagulant

-	Inappropriately filled test tubes

-	Inappropriately stored blood

-	Hyperlipidemic, icteric or hemolyzed blood

-	Hct >55%

__Corrective action:__

-	Mix thoroughly by gentle inversion and follow proper order of draw (Na citrate)

-	Make sure that test tube fills up to the mark indicated on the top of the tube

-	Must be tested within 4 hours and do not refrigerate. If not received in our lab within 4 hours of collection, sample must be centrifuged and platelet-poor plasma removed from cells and transferred to an aliquot tube and freeze at -20°C and deliver to the lab on dry ice within 2 weeks.

-	Centrifuging before sample is clotted

-	 Patients with a hematocrit level >55% must have a special tube made to adjust for the hematocrit 

__Post analytical errors:__

-	Result reporting

-	Result interpretation

-	Result distribution
