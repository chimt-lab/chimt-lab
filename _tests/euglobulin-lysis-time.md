__Sample type:__

 blood sample, plasma

__Uses:__

 a test measures overall fibrinolysis. 

__precautions__

•	When drawing the sample, be careful not to rub the area over the vein too vigorously, pump the fist excessively, or leave the tourniquet in place too long.

•	Avoid excessive probing during venipuncture, and handle the sample gently.

•	If a blue-top tube is used, mix the sample and anticoagulant thoroughly. If a chilled tube containing 0.5 ml sodium oxalate is used, mix the sample and preservative thoroughly, pack the sample in ice, and send it to the laboratory immediately.

__Interfering factor:__

•	Prolonged tourniquet constriction, vigorous vein preparation, or excessive pumping of the fist (decrease).

•	Hemolysis due to excessive probing at the venipuncture site or to rough handling of the sample.

•	Failure to place the collection tube and sample on ice

•	Fibrinogen level < 100 mg/dl (possible decrease)

__Pre-analytical error:__

•	Coagulation samples should not be transported or stored on ice 

•	Coagulation samples for platelet function studies must be maintained at room temperature

•	Gentle inversion (mixing) of sodium citrates tube 5–6 times is recommended. Avoid rigorous shaking or agitation 69 3.2% sodium citrate is the citrate concentration of choice

•	If the syringe technique is to be used, then a syringe of less than 25 mL (preferably 10 mL) using a “butterfly” needle apparatus

__Post analytical errors:__

•	Check instrument settings 

•	Assure that all preventive maintenance has been done 

•	Carry out troubleshooting functions called for in the SOP 

•	Call for equipment support

__Corrective action:__

•	Assure that the prescribed preventive maintenance for the instrument is performed 

__Reference Ranges__

   Hyperfibrinolysis: <60 minutes

   Hypofibrinolysis: >240 minutes
