__Sample type:__ 

Citrated Plasma (& Brown clotted serum, gel barrier if part of a thrombophilia screen) 

__Uses:__ 

TT measures the time of conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin once thrombin (used as a reagent) is added 

__Precautions:__ no specific precautions needed

__Interfering factor:__

-	The assay is sensitive to low concentrations of heparin provided the tested plasma is collected without activation and release of platelet alpha granules, which contain PF4, a heparin inhibitor.

-	Various drugs or treatments can affect TT results. An additional investigation should be realized to determine the origin of each unexpected abnormal result.

__Pre-analytical errors:__

-	collection of blood specimens 

-	prolonged tourniquet placing

-	inappropriate mixing of a sample

__Corrective action__ 

-	good mixing for the sample

-	proper collection of the sample 

__Post analytical errors:__

-	Check instrument settings 

__Reference range:__
