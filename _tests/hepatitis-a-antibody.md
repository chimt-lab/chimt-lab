__Sample type:__

-	Serum (yellow tube is preferred or red tube is acceptable)

__Uses:__

-	Serological diagnosis of acute viral hepatitis A depends on the detection of specific anti-HAV IgM. Its presence in the patient's serum indicates a recent exposure to HAV. HAV-specific IgM antibody level becomes detectable in the blood by 4 weeks after infection, persisting at elevated levels for about 2 months before declining to undetectable levels by 6 months. They rarely persist beyond 12 months after infection.

-	IgG (immunoglobulin G) antibodies. These show up after the virus has been in your body for a while. You may have them all your life. They protect you against hepatitis A. If you test positive for them but not for IgM antibodies, it means you had a hepatitis A infection in the past or had vaccinations to protect against it.


__Precaution:__

-	Haemolysed, icteric, lipemic or microbially contaminated serum is not recommended for testing.

-	Please do not use the kit beyond the expiration

-	indicated on the kit box and reagent labels.

-	Should be Calculation of Cut-off value correctly.

-	Storage and stability of reagents: All test kit materials must be stored between 2 - 8°C in the dark. Strips not to be used immediately should be stored airtight in the laminate bag together with the desiccant. The shelf-life of components after opening is not affected, if used appropriately.



 




__Interfering factors:__

-	If patient is vaccinated against this vires don’t do this test qualitative but should do this test quantitative to know the quantity of vires. 

-	Testing too early (<2 weeks) after exposure to hepatitis A (HAV) may yield negative anti-HAV IgM results.

-	False-positive results may be due to the presence of cross-reactive antibodies from other viral infection or underlying illnesses (such as nonHodgkin lymphoma). Positive results should be correlated with patient’s clinical history and epidemiologic exposure.

-	The presence of heterohilic antibodies and human antimouse antibodies (in patients who have received preparations of mouse monoclonal antibodies for diagnosis or therapy) in serum may interfere with the assay and cause erroneous results (false-positive or false-negative).

-	Performance characteristics have not been established for the following specimens: Grossly icteric (total bilirubin >20 mg/dL), grossly hemolyzed (hgb level >500 mg/dL), grossly lipemic (triolein >3,000 mg/dL), containing particulate matter, heat-inactivated, cadaveric specimens. 

__Pre analytical error:__ 

1)	Specimens other than serum; improper labeling; samples not stored properly; samples older than stability limits; gross hemolysis; gross lipemia.

2)	 Take sample type different from that recommended in this test and analysis it in laboratory.

3)	Not to put the name of the patient or error when putting the code of patient on the tube when sampling.

4)	If the samples is grossly lipemic after centrifugate it
   
__Corrective action:__ 

1)	refused the sample and ordered another sample.

2)	The sample should be rejected and order another sample. 

3)	anther sample request and should attention at next time.

4)	Centrifuge the sample again, if it still lipemic reject this sample and another sample will be requested
 

__Post analytical error:__

1)	Sharing the results of patients or writing the result incorrectly.

2)	write a wrong Patient name   in patient report.

__Corrective action:__

1)	communicate with patient then delivered him the correct results   and   we apologize for this mistake.

2)	the report is not delivered to the patient and the error must be discovered.
