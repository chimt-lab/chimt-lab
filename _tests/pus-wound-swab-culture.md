Wound culture must be taken from clean tissue because pus or necrotic tissue will not provide an accurate profile of the microflora contained within the tissue

__Sample type:__

Deep-tissue biopsy: A deep-tissue or punch biopsy for a quantitative culture is the gold standard for identifying wound bioburden and diagnosing infection.

__Uses:__

The test is used to find out if a wound is infected. It can also see the type of organism that's causing the infection. This test is done with a small sample of tissue or fluid from a wound

__Precautions:__

- Apply a small amount of antibiotic ointment. 

- Cover wounds with a bandage or gauze dressing.

- Keep the wound clean and dry for the first 24 hours.

- Wash your hands before and after you care for wound

__Interfering Factors:__

Wound healing can be delayed by factors local to the wound itself, including desiccation, infection or abnormal bacterial presence, maceration, necrosis, pressure, trauma, and edema.

__Corrective action:__

Treating pus depends on how serious the infection causing it is. For small abscesses on your skin's surface, applying a wet, warm compress can help drain pus. Apply the compress a few times a day for several minutes. Just make sure you avoid the urge to squeeze the abscess.
