__Sample type:__ 

Nasopharyngeal swabs or aspirates are the specimens of choice for recovery of B. pertussis.

__Test use:__ 

This test checks for Bordetella pertussis antibodies in your blood. B. pertussis are the bacteria that cause pertussis, also called whooping cough. Whooping cough is a highly contagious childhood infection that can also affect adults. 

__Precautions:__ 

Wearing a surgical mask within 3 feet of the patient provides protection from the spread of pertussis. Often times, close household contacts are the source of the child's infection; therefore, providers should also wear masks when within 3 feet of symptomatic parents or siblings. 

__Interfering factors:__ 

The target for the B pertussis PCR reaction, a region of IS481, is also found in Bordetella holmesii. A false-positive result for B pertussis DNA may occur if B holmesii is present in the sample tested. 

__Pre analytical errors:__ 

Calcium alginate swabs; swabs in noncharcoalcontaining transport media; swabs in Regan-Lowe culture media. 

__Post analytical errors:__ 

1)	Delayed report. 

2)	You may be instructed not to eat (fast) six hours before the test 

__Corrective actions:__ 

Be careful during taking the swap from penetrating the mucous.
