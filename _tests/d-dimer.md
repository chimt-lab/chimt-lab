__-	Sample type:__

 Blood should be collected in a blue-top tube containing 3.2% buffered sodium citrate

__-	Uses:__

 D-dimer test is used to find out if you have a blood clotting disorder. These disorders include: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a blood clot that's deep inside a vein.

__-	Precautions:__ 

 Avoid contaminating the sample with tissue thromboplastin or heparin. Venipuncture must be performed with no trauma. Hemolysis samples are not acceptable.

__-	Interfering factors:__

There are several physiologic states or medical conditions that may cause patients to have an elevated D-dimer in the absence of PE, DVT, or DIC. These include but are not limited to pregnancy, malignancy, cigarette smoking, trauma, or infection, or sepsis.

__-	Pre analytical errors:__

1)	Sample collection 

2)	needle size, collection tube,

3)	sample delivery to the laboratory (e.g. pneumatic tube system (PTS), temperature),

4)	Sample processing (e.g. centrifugation, hemolysis samples.


__-	Corrective action:__

(i)	It is done in the serum.

(ii)	Collect 2 ml blood in a test tube containing Thrombin, soybean, and Trypsin inhibitor.

__-	Post analytical errors:__

(iii)	Evaluation of test results

(iv)	Decision to release test results

(v)	Preparation of the laboratory test report

(vi)	Release of the laboratory test report

__-	Reference rang :__

The reference concentration of D-dimer is < 250 ng/mL, or < 0.4 Î¼/m
