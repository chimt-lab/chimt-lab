__Sample type:__

Serum.

__Uses:__

-	This test measures the amount of cancer antigen 15-3 (CA 15-3) in your blood. CA 15-3 is a substance that stimulates your body's defense system. Some kinds of cancer cells release the CA 15-3 antigen into the blood. This test is used to monitor certain types of cancer as breast cancer.

__Precautions:__

-	Certain medications and supplements can interfere with the CA 15-3 test. Among them is biotin (also known as vitamin B7, vitamin B8, vitamin H, or coenzyme R). The CA 15-3 test relies on biotin to bind to the CA 15-3 antigen and may be affected if too much biotin is consumed.

-	While the recommended daily intake of biotin is unlikely to cause any harm, high-dose biotin supplements may trigger false-negative readings. Stop taking any supplement containing more than 0.03 milligrams of biotin 72 hours before the test.

__Interfering Factors:__

-	Test results may vary depending on your age, gender, health history, the method used for the test, and other things. Your test results may not mean you have a problem.

__Pre analytical errors:__

1)	Taking supplement containing more than 0.03 milligrams of biotin 72 hours before the test.

2)	Giving the patient not sufficient amount of the targeted cancer drug Afinitor (everolimus).

__Corrective action:__

1)	Stop taking biotin 72hrs before the test.

2)	Giving the patient sufficient amount of everolimus.

__Post analytical errors:__

1)	Failure in reporting.

2)	Erroneous validation of analytical data.

3)	Improper data entry.

__Corrective action:__

1)	Write correct report.

2)	All analytical data should be valid

3)	Proper data entery.

__Reference range:__

The reference range of serum CA 15-3 is less than 30 U/mL. The upper limit of the range varies depending on the laboratory and kit used for the test.
