__-->	Sample type:__

Serum.

__-->	Uses:__

The best test for diagnosing Addison’s disease is a cortisol assay in blood and urine, with or without an ACTH test. In the presence of primary adrenal insufficiency (low cortisol levels and very high ACTH levels), a doctor can confirm the presence of an autoimmune disorder by testing for anti-adrenal antibodies.

__-->	Precautions:__

1) Lipemic or grossly hemolyzed serum should not be used in this assay. 

2) Results should always be interpreted in the context of clinical symptoms and adrenal functional confirmatory tests.

3) Volume: 3 mL (Minimum: 0.6 mL) blood.

__-->	Interfering Factors:__

1) Using a medication or supplement that causes excessive bleeding.

2) The higher the temperature, the higher the absorption values will be. The optimal temperature during the Enzyme Immunoassay is between 20–25 °C.

3) The used sample volume determines the sensitivity of this test.

__-->	Pre analytical errors:__

1)	Exercise or physical activity.

2)	Stress before performing this test.

3)	Avoid herbal medicines and any medication which interferes with the test.

4)	Avoid a nuclear scan before this test.

__-->	Corrective action:__

Duplicate the wells and check the storage of the sample.

__-->	Post analytical errors:__

1) Entering wrong parameter.

2) Change the temperature of the equipment before reading the absorbance.

__-->	Reference range:__ 

Negative: <1:10.
